The airport is certainly tiny! Arriving there was good off the plane quick straight onto a connecting bus to Brussels. Staff at the information stand were helpful & spoke English. The outbound journey wasn't as pleasant security was over zealous (having to remove belt watch etc) and very unfriendly. Didn't bother using the 'canteen' in the cupboard (departure lounge 1) and there was a big crush fighting fellow passengers to get on the aircraft. The toilets in the lounge were filthy stinking & graffitid. Having said that for a flight that cost about the same as a pizza it's worth putting up with and I'd use it again.
Small airports are generally intimate friendly and welcoming. Not so with Charleroi. It is dirty seriously overcrowded at peak times and facilities are terrible. Ryanair does a good job of running a base on these facilities mind. Links to Brussels are good but that's really thanks to Ryanair themselves. Food is terrible and waiting areas are not so conducive to extended stays (extended being anything more than 15 minutes)
Waited an hour in a corridor for baggage but ours was the only arrival in 3 hours. Waited 45 mins for the bus driver to let people on then he went off for a 30 min fag break which meant we missed the connecting train to Brussels we could have walked quicker to town centre. Return journey was even worse with one room which combined a corner shop style duty free school canteen snack bar non segregated smoking area which led to a single stinking toilet. It was a relief when the exits opened and we all made a charge for our non pre-allocated seats. Cheap but not cheerful next time I will pay the extra and fly direct from Manchester to Brussels Zaventem.
"The previous comment is so off the mark it must have been written by one of the ""anti-Ryanair"" squad. Getting to / from the airport: an executive coach leaves Brussels south station (Gare du Midi) 2h. 30m. before each flight departure. As the average journey (± 60 km) takes one hour the bus arrives 90 minutes before the flight departs - in other words 60 minutes before check-in closes. The bus parks ± 50 metres from the departures door. For the return journey: buses leave the airport 20 mins or so after the flight arrivals back to Brussels Gare du Midi. At weekends I have done this journey in 40 minutes. Cost: €10.00 single payable to the driver. This includes an arbitrary €3.60 tax imposed by the Chairleroi Airport which is the subject of a legal action by Ryanair who charter the buses. Train / bus connections are not so good. I have written twice to TEC (Charleroi) asking why at weekends their ""connectional"" bus #68 from the airport arrives at Charleroi Railway station three minutes AFTER the hourly trains depart to Brussels. No intellgible answer was forthcoming - but they are Francophones and don't ever take criticism - just offer a ""Gallic shrug"". A ""joined-up public transport service"" - NOT! Parking is plentiful and cheap with free shuttle buses to/from the terminal every 10 minutes. The cafe resembles a motorway service station in UK but food and drink are comparatively cheap for the standard offered. Best to stock up here before your 60-90 minute flight so that you don't die of starvation or pay €9.00 on-board for a sandwich. This can be more than the cost of the flight! From the terminal passengers walk to the plane across the tarmac ± 100 metres. Boarding is fronty and rear so very quick. In the new Schengen terminal in Brussels Zaventem airport it can take up to 20 minutes to walk to the most remote departure gate! There are plans to expand Charleroi Airport with a second terminal in 2006 assuming that the European Commission's latest investigation hasn't scuppered the Ryanair operation by then. I have no connection with Charleroi Airport nor with Ryanair (the only flight operator)."
The airport resulbles a shack. A very bad cafe and unfriendly staff across the whole airport. I will never use this airport again. It is a nightmare even trying to get to this excuse of an airport. My advice to anybody thinking of using this airport use Brussels National insteade.
"This is an incredibly confusing airport. Check in was fine but the passage to the gates winds through poorly marked duty free stores. Security was also good but by the third time you have to ask yourself ""where to now?"" the frustration has built. If I had been in a hurry I would have become furious."
Zaventem my home airport. Lots of nostalgic childhood memories because of the Sabena frequent flyer status of my father. Nowadays very nice check in lounge lots of good food drinking options Zaventem was and is Belgium's number one airport. The luggage pick up is still too slow. Smoking lounges too overcrowded and too small. But despite this few minor negative points Zaventem is a good organised clean airport its still the number one hub in Europe.
Brussels to Zurich - The first impression was a disorderly airport and long queues. Not a very appealing interior ill-planned layout of the airport makes you go up and down several times. Not many things to look for while waiting for the flight. This airport is clearly not at par with other European standard airports.
I flew from BRU on a transatlantic flight to New York. I arrived well in time but the Airport security had a 2 hour waiting line at the passport check. This meant that I almost missed my flight which was extremely frustrating. I cannot comprehend why this Airport is so incompetent in one of its main duties. I recommend flying out of AMS or DUS.
I've read some of the critical reviews on this site and while Brussels airport is not the best airport I know I believe things have got better lately. The frequency of trains to and from the airport has increased some trains are still the old shuttle trains from Brussels but others are the very reasonable longer distance trains running through Belgium. The roadworks close to the airport are over. But more roadworks could be planned. The departure hall can be crowded but some low cost flights are now handled in a separate extension of the departure hall making room in the rest of the airport. The Schengen gates used to be accessible via a long underground tunnel with lots of escalators. These have gone now: there is a new 'connector' building that is much more pleasant to go to the A gates. The new shops toilets restaurants in the A gates area look nice some restaurants still close relatively early. The non-Schengen gates are less bright but the new connector building now also improves the transfer from A to C gates and vice-versa. On my last visit to the airport my luggage was on the luggage retrieval belt before I got there so zero wait. The arrival hall is still the low-ceiling area it used to be quite unwelcoming.
"1) Please stop continuously changing gates! On our most recent trip it was changed an unbelievable 5 times! 2) Invest in an adequate loudspeaker system. 3) The acoustic is from the dark ages. 4) Various areas are not covered by working loudspeakers. 5) Train the announcers to articulate to slow down. 6) Employ people with excellent foreign language skills or native speakers. 7) Install more info counters. 8) Learn from ""top"" airports."
As long as I live I will never get a connecting flight from this airport again nightmare of a journey from Gates A to B if your on a tight connecting flight expect to be running around. Expect very poor signage and awful attitude from airport staff and officials.
I am a regular visitor of Zaventem Airport unfortunately because it is one of the worst airports in Europe. Traffic to the airport is a nightmare. Narrow and always blocked by never ending roadworks. Trains to the airport are dirty and at least 40 year old wrecks and you pay an horrendous price. Ticket area for trains is small dirty and always full with people queuing for the one single open sales point. (Machines do not accept foreign cards or credit cards.) Luggage delivery takes an average of 1.5 hours (yes 1.5 hours) almost a world record. Waiting time for the passport control can be up to 2 hours. The non-Schengen shopping area is almost non-existent. -Cleanliness and overall the state of maintenance is very poor. My advise go to Paris CDG. From there 1h 12m TGV to Brussels. That's much quicker as fighting yourself trough the Zaventem chaos.
I had the bad luck to spend 3 hours at EBBR in the transfer area. My connection flight to England with Brussels Airlines was delayed 2hrs which was actually good because the ways from the arrival gate to the departure gate B30 was a nightmare of a walk. After passing through yet another security land and yet another passport check (Schengen my butt) I had to walk another few kilometres to the gate in order to wait there for my flight. Being used to rather posh German airports the overall appearance of this airport was: a bland megalomaniac hellhole of gigantic boredom with everything outdated. Endless corridors to the gates and ending with dirty and tasteless seats in the waiting areas not to mention the toilets. It's like entering a 3rd-world country. If you are a smoker you'll appreciate the extremely sparse smoking areas. Very few bistros (I actually saw only one) that close very soon in the evening and a saddening mass of saddening vending machines top off the overall horrible experience with that airport. If I can avoid passing though EBBR I'll pay any amount of Euros to do so.
Worst airport visited. Long line up for immigration and no indication at all first line up 30 minutes then an airport staff member told us that we were at the wrong line we had headed to another line for international passengers even longer we spent 1 hour and 15 minutes to get through the immigration which was my flight departure time. Air Canada staff were kindly waiting for us at the last minute.
"I will never book a trip with Brussels airport as the transfer point. While the airport facilities were good transferring from hall A to Hall B is a disaster. We were leaving Europe and it is necessary to line up for passport review. There was a line 150 feet long about 200 people and they only have 2 stations to serve you. Serve is the wrong word it took 40 minutes to get through this point. The two staff were rude. They have very poor signage and it turned out that one line was for Euro Zone residents and the other for non Euro people. People were crowded into lines trying to get to the front only to be told they were in the wrong one. People were complaining because they were going to miss their flights. It was chaos. Then to top it off this young Passport Control supervisor yells at everyone that if they don't calm down he ""will close the border""! The root problem is that this transfer area is only designed to have two kiosks. They can't even put more staff on. The worst bottleneck design I have seen in my many years travelling."
Having arrived from Montreal (YUL) after originally departing from Toronto (YYZ) and being about 03.00 by my body clock I found my way to passport control ok reasonable queue very nice officers and then off to Duty Free before connecting to Bristol (BRS). Arriving in the non-Schengen zone my connection was also in the same zone so I headed off to the desk for the connection on my ticket. A quick trip through fast track security and off to the gate. Seems that I missed that flight and the desk agent ran off to do something or other to get me moving. She returned and handed me a new ticket for KLM to AMS. Back though passport control again no queue at all same nice officers and off to the other terminal. The ticket barcode access scanner for fast track security tells me to go to the original terminal and refuses to open so I just jump the rail and tell a security person on duty about the plane change who lets me through with no question. Second time through security scanning another passport stamp (3 in 1 hour) and off to the gate. Agent says to me with a dirty look that she was looking for me hours ago. Explained the changes and delays she turned pleasant checked me in and hit my seat with moments to spare. All in all it was a bit of a crazy time but it worked out and I had no real issues with any staff clerks officers at all. Will be back at BRU again next June when I'll have a one day stop-over to properly suss out the airport. But until then I give it a Recommended rating.
Awful possibly the worst transfer I've ever done. B gates are very old and shabby and involve a huge walk from the A terminal. Had to go through baggage claim and security again despite only travelling between Portugal and the UK on a connecting code share flight. Also had to argue for quite some time to allow my duty free to travel through security. Final insult was that my connecting flight was heavily delayed with very little information and the bars all closed at 7.30 despite there being a World Cup on and flights still leaving up to 11. Terrible experience will avoid like the plague.
I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess. While everyone is waiting for his luggage you may have to collect more revenue from parking.
Worst airport I have ever been in after 60 years of travelling all over the world. There was incorrect labelling of connections and we were sent in the wrong direction by an airport staff member who was directing passengers. This caused us to miss a very tight connection. Security was so offensive.
Using Brussels airport for transit was a nightmare this morning. All transit passengers have to go through long queues for passport control and security which led the flight delay overunning outgoing flight time. This was delayed luckily - but passenger announcements were not made to let those involved know. Just that the last call had been made. The distance between the incoming gates and outgoing gates is truly enormous - but why when we were put on a bus to drive a further few kms to get to the aircraft? Why not have bus after a short walk if it has to go that far? Why were the Security staff telling us to go back to the check in desk to get another flight (and have to go through Passport Control and Security again) without first checking if the flight was being held (which they did at the second attempt)? Finally on arrival at destination - no baggage - it is still a Brussels. I will not try these routes again.
"29 July 2013. Worst Airport in Europe. Had to fly out of here on busy day. Allowed 3 hours. Small signs. Rude personnel apart from check-in man who was good. Tax refund department quote ""this is not my regular job"" as he dropped forms (losing 2 permanently) and shuffled papers. Huge queues. Unable to process English tax forms at Travelex in Brussels Airport. Poor duty free. Limited calls for airline lucky to reach airline on last call despite allowing 3 hours for check in."
Missed connecting flight due to huge backlog in passport customs control. In addition to this did not receive luggage to and from destination due to baggage handlers work to rule strike. Too much ground to cover when making a connecting flight.
Having to go from section A to B entails having to go through security and passport control and the distance is very long. This would not be an issue if there was plenty of time between flights. The 3 factors combined distance + passport control + security resulted in my being bumped of the flight as the airline thought 30 mins was not enough time to get from sector A to B. Then there is the baggage handlers strike which has added fuel to fire on the return. We have not heard from Swissport who handlers baggage on the status of the strike. The website does not recognize the airline tag when you try and get the status of your baggage. Almost a week later and no one has bothered to contact the passengers either by email or by phone. We had to wait 2 hours to get file our lost luggage claim in Paris. I lost money for the pre-paid taxi as a result which Swissport said they would not pay. So all in all I would not recommend flying through Brussels airport.
"This is my local airport which I use regularly. Easy access and plentiful parking. Spacious clean and easy to navigate terminals. Queues through security now shorter than previously. Good selection of shops and restaurants/cafes in the Schengen terminal. Major negative for me is the interminable time it takes to retrieve gold clubs on arrival and often having to ""go looking"" for them. Probably the worst airport I have experienced on this point."
Transited through BRU en-route to ORD. The airport is nice and clean though dated. Did not look flashy like O'Hare. Staff are helpful. Quiet understated airport. The cafe was nice and selection of food excellent. Not crowded like many other Airports in Europe but duty free selection is nice. This is a good airport for transiting. Not a madhouse like LHR. Was bussed to the waiting Sabena plane.
Having travelled around the world I am always amazed about the poor quality of Brussels Zaventem airport which happens to be my home airport. Whereas departures may go smoothly arrivals are a nightmare. Many times the plane cannot get to the gate because ground staff are not present so we have to wait. Luggage takes average up to 40 minutes after landing in the best case whereas airports much bigger such as HKG Singapore and Barcelona who manage to deliver them by the time you get to the carrousel. Luggage delivery is unorganized and usually a big mess with several planes on 1 carrousel and the next carrousel empty. Cleanliness is so poor the restrooms smell and are dirty the waiting seats are dirty.
The airport does what it needs to do but no more. Access - by bus in/out: long waiting outside overloaded no space for baggage connecting with public transport requires carrying luggage down on crowded narrow stairs - very uncomfortable! By train: in house sometimes very dirty trains no space for baggage - more comfortable better access to the public transport system. Taxis are comfortable but hard to find at first time. Inside walking distances - Prepare yourself for long walks changing levels 3 times up and down on escalators and a huge queue in front of the security screening area in the evenings. Plan 60 mins to arrive at the boarding gate as net fast walk time exceeds 20 mins and wait time at the screening can take 30 mins. Toilets - There are many toilets they are easy to find. There are no toilets in the lounges. Flight information - There is usually no gate information on the screens until -30 of departure but it will be printed on the boarding pass at check-in. WIFI is available but expensive. Restaurants are good but expensive. Lounges are overloaded with people in the evening. The food is far below average. Boarding goes smoothly and usually directly from the terminal over a gangway. Baggage claim - Expect your luggage to be late. Overall nothing is horrible but it's a quite uncomfortable airport for European standards.
I used the airport in October 2012. Since it was a morning flight I arrived at the airport by the first train! Had plenty of time to explore the airport. Check in with SN Brussels airlines bound to Milan was smooth. Security control also fast enough. The immigration agent friendly. Found the airport fairly passenger friendly easy to find way out with good signage everywhere.
Been through this airport literally hundreds of times in my working life. There are two terminals
I arrived from Warsaw in the evening on 12th September. The airport was having peak hours with many arrivals and departures at the same time. However it was easy to navigate around the airport due to clear and good signages. It was a long walk from the aircraft however luggage was on the belt when we arrived at the luggage claim area. The train service to and from the airport was good where I was in the city less than 90 minutes from the time we landed.
Used this airport on the 4th of August for my trip to Bangkok via Istanbul. The 18.15 departure to Istanbul. Check-in was very busy but the line moved quickly and the check-in agent was friendly. Passport control and security at terminal B (non Schengen) was very fast with friendly officers. The flight was boarded in zones and this was enforced. Passengers in an other boarding zone were not allowed to go to the plane until the passengers from the announced boarding zone were boarded. The return on the 25th of August at 21.35 was smooth. No lines at immigration and when we reached the luggage reclaim the bags were already coming to the carrousel. Clean airport with nice and friendly airport staff. At terminal B there were a lots of shops after passport control and before security. And after security there was also a bar and Duty Free shop.
Landed tonight one of the last flights. Waited for 30 minutes for a gate agent to get the jetway so we could leave the plane. You may as well fly to Antwerp and walk to Brussels given how far Terminal A is from the exit. You'd think they would have put in a train or shuttle. Nope. Why do something that would add to the customer experience? Never check your bags at BRU or you will be over an hour before you get out. In short the ground staff are next to useless the design of the terminals is daft and often requires a hiking expedition to get to your flight and the customer service is often profoundly rude bordering on incompetent.
Security queues can be long here at busy times with only some of the lines open. Apart from that its an efficient airport except that the distances involves can be large. Be especially careful if you are transferring from the A gates to B gates as the distance between is long (I would allow 45 mins just to get from one gate to the other).
In the summer I wrote a review criticising two aspect of Brussels airport
Horrible airport long queues no signs telling you where to go. The toilet facilities are quite bad. I was in the passport-queue for 45 minutes. I had quite a lot of hand luggage and I couldn't find a single hand luggage cart! To top it all you have to pay for the liquid gel bags? Very inefficient and hostile airport.
This is one of the most inefficient airports. This airport is not really adapted for internal European flights. For a 1 hr flight you need to walk at least 15 minutes before having a chance to reach the exit and if by misfortune you had checked in bags then you won't be out of the airport in less than 30 mins minimum.
DEL-BRU-GVA. Arrived on a Jet airways flight. Landed at T-B onward connection to Geneva from T-1 Brussels Airlines. I am a Swiss Citizens so didn't have to go through the non-EU passport control long queue. Got to the Security check and as expected long queue there. Finally boarded my flight to Geneva with few minutes to spare. I can assure you that if I was a non-EU citizen my flight would have left.
"Although it's becoming an important European hub Zaventem airport still keep a ""human"" size and moving between and within terminals is quite easy. Organized efficiently there are a lot of shopping and eating options lounges are well located and lines in migration customs and security-checks run efficiently. Staff overall are friendly."
BRU is easy to get around and walking distances were short. Luggage took a bit longer to be unloaded on arrival but otherwise no complaints. We arrived at about 7.30 am for our return flight to Canada and virtually skipped through security. One negative at least as far as I could see - on arrival at the airport we were looking forward to a relaxed breakfast before our flight however there were no sit down restaurants within sight of our departure gate.
This airport gives me a nice home-feel not too big and overcrowded and yet all the services one needs (shops lounges). Security lines can be long at rush hour but not exaggerated.
Pleasant airport lots of shops and restaurants bit overpriced. Lounges are too small always overcrowded. Airport is clean but not spotless (room for improvement) and you need to walk a lot to get to your gate. The A terminal is 1km in length and it takes about 15min to get there from the main entrance building. The luggage control is over crowded too.
BRU is quite inefficient. The design of the airport maximises transfer times due to large distances and a design combining multiple walkways and escalators. It took us more than 10mins to walk to the passport control from our flight gate. Several passport control desks seemed to be unmanned resulting in a wait of approx 90 mins to clear it. The only advantage of an almost 2hr transit between the flight landing and baggage collection was that the baggage was on the carousal when we arrived there. Upon arriving at the train station at the airport we had to wait approx 15 mins to be served as only 2 counters were open. During departure via Brussels airlines we had to wait 45mins to drop off our bags (checked-in at the airport kiosk) which is probably not the airports fault. However the long walks and 20mins for security check definitely are. Strong advice - please arrive at this airport at least 2hrs prior to departure esp if flying Brussels airlines.
I have used Brussels 4-6 times a year for about 20 years. Generally it is a well-organised easy to use airport with good facilities. However two things are very irritating and both could be improved at little cost. Firstly if one arrives from a non-Schengen state and the aircraft is parked in a remote spot (as is often the case) you are taken by bus to the terminal. This is fine except the bus drops passengers at a door that is a good 200m from the immigration control point so a rush of people up the stairs and along a very long corridor develops. Why not simply drop everyone closer to the passport check point - there appear to be doors already in place? Secondly there is a train into the centre of the city: frequent regular and efficient. As usual there were two sales points open and queues stretched out of the booking hall.
Has no electricity connectors foreseen for visitors of other countries. Waiting on your luggage becomes longer and longer every month. In the beginning luggage took around 15mins to claim now you have to wait around 45-60 mins.
Well organized airport with GOOD security checks. Queues are well organized processing is speedy with helpful attendants. Good selection of shops and food-outlets once you are through security. Restaurants fairly priced and courteous staff. Good selection of authentic Belgian products at competitive prices.
Flew several times to/from BRU. Generally positive experience. Last time efficient check-in quick passport and smooth security (though it wasn't anything near rush hour). The walk to the gate saves you time in a gym
I use Brussels Airport every time so on average 20 times a year. It's very easy to reach by public transport and by car (there were some rush hour queues when the infrastructure was being rebuilt but that's finished now) very difficult to find a parking space close to the terminal on busy days. Kiss and ride zone works very efficiently when Police are patrolling without Police it's chaos because people leave their car parked. In 90% of the times never had to wait more than 30 minutes for checking in (I don't bother checking in online or using the machines) Staff is usually very friendly and they know multiple languages. Security can be really bad on some days so expect long queues. Again in about 80% of the time got through in less than half an hour. Terminal A is modern very spacious and very nice to be in but about 15 minutes of walking from the check-in area. Terminal B is older but does not look aged less shops and less seating. Baggage drop off was very efficient my luggage would be waiting on the belt but that's changed after some worker strikes. Expect 20-30 minutes of wait (when you arrive at the belt which is also about 20 minutes after arrival at the gate).
Transited BRU earlier this month. Total chaos. Landed from MXP in terminal B long walk to terminal A for connecting flight to PHL. Passport control not bad but as heading up stairs to get to security was faced with a sea of people coming down the stairs. Seems main security checkpoint was overloaded and they were directing people to use alternate at far end of A terminal. Had to walk to end of terminal where there was a mass of people queuing for 2 checkpoints. 45 minutes through then up to departures and back to the other end of the terminal to the gate. Very little to look at air side no food nor shopping this was mainly pre security as was duty free kiosk so could not get that stamped forfeiting the refund. Not the best experience.
I have never had a good experience at Brussels Airport. Travelling to Africa via Brussels makes you feel like a third class citizen (whatever your skin colour). You are almost forced into using a transfer bus from a virtually unheated part of the airport. If you can find another way to Africa that does not involve passing through Brussels take it.
Flew from the UK to Oslo via Brussels Airport return. Signage and directions were extremely confusing and the security staff were rude and arrogant. I don't know how old the Airport is but the facilities were dated and unclean.
Clean easy to access at low price from city centre by train. Confusing in the check-in zone but once you pass security fantastic shopping plenty of space to sit good indications and long distances so enough time is needed to join the flights to Africa.
BOM-BRU-CDG. Transit through BRU on Jet Airways. Landed at 0750 at concourse B with onward flight to CDG at 0940 from concourse A. After a long walk through concourse B reached passport control. 4 counters operating for non EU citizens with more than 200 people in line. Took an agonizing 1 hour and 10 min to clear. Again a long walk to reach concourse A. Security check took another 10 min. Had to rush to my gate to avoid missing the flight and reached just 2 minutes before scheduled departure time. No clear or enough directions to reach the gates. I guess the airlines are used to it and they waited for an additional 15-20 minutes for passengers who were stuck in the BRU maze. Please avoid transiting through BRU if you can or allow at least 3 hours to transit.
Access to and from the airport is easy by car or rail. If you arrive too early for check in there is no seating so either be prepared to stand or come a bit later. Security checks can be tiring - depending of course on how many people are waiting in line. Was not required to take off shoes since they have a new machine that you simply stand on. I was however required to take off my belt and every once in about three times I used this airport was body searched as well. Once you go through all the hassle it gets more calm there is usually enough seating and the waiting is OK. All in all a clean and efficient airport. The only really bother: you may have a very long walk from arrival gate to passport control since the terminal is a long corridor. If you're lucky you will land closer to the terminal.
I used to like travelling through Brussels Airport : not anymore ! The few last month the airport experience has turned from pleasant to very anoying due to the lack of staff . Lack of staff at check in with Brussels airlines : the airline is trying to force everybody to check on line and the result is long queues at the airport. Lack of staff at boarding pass control : another line before getting to the terminal. Lack of staff at security where now you have to take off shoes every time with rude and bored staff and queues getting longer each month. Altogether a very bad experience and no time left to spend some time and money in the shops.
Cool modern design and lots of space to sit. I arrived in BRU too early and thus had a long wait for my flight and found you have to pay for the wireless internet. No entertainment thus. The free charging stations for your laptop/cell phone were useful though. Toilets clean (despite someone had been smoking in there). What I really found annoying was the journey to the luggage claim up and down escalators and long corridors. I also didn't realize the exit was in the middle of the luggage claim area and not in the end and thus wandered around looking a bit lost. There was also no mailbox after the security check - I forgot to mail my postcards before going in. The maps claimed there should've been one but I really couldn't find it. Rail connection to Brussels ok railway station sterile and boring.
Good airport I have used it a few times nice and clean. Never really had the chance to check duty free though. But be prepared to walk and I mean really walk 3 floors down and then under the park bays (?) and 3 floors up. The designer should have been a health freak.. the last thing I want when rushing to meetings is a 20 minute jog to exit an airport!
Terminal A is a dreadful place where one can easily got lost. When arriving there's an endless walk to the exit with escalators up and down and miles of moving walkways with few and confusing signs in this shopping of an airport. Finding the train station is quite a challenge too. The automatic tickets vending machines only accept Belgium cards. On the positive side it's a clean place full of natural light but designed by someone who never use airports!
Nice airport but they do love their escalators don't they? There is one after another to go anywhere. It is almost comical. I had heard about this but seeing it in person made me laugh. Grab a piece of chocolate to keep your energy up!
Terminal A for Schengen flights is quite comfortable with much natural daylight and plenty of seating areas. But it is quite a long walk to the baggage claim area using numerous escalators. Catering is good and reasonably priced. Trains to downtown Brussels run every 20min and are cheap. Please note that the ticket vending machines accept Euro coins only and no credit cards. Signals in the check-in halls could be improved as it is rather difficult to locate the right counter.
Very long queues for security tonight in zone B in Brussels. At least a 400m queue to reach the scanners it started just after the passport check desks and it was slow moving. This did not seem to have any obvious cause. With the mega long walks you can have here a good reason to be prudent.
Brussels Airport is convenient and most of the time easy to travel through. Bright and airy the Shengen terminal is much better than the older one and also offers more opportunities for shopping. Recently longs queues for security have appeared and the airport management should find a solution to this problem.
BRU Zaventem Airport has made significant improvements over the last couple of years. I was in and out of this airport almost monthly for 4 years and despite most often using the rather old B concourse they have not only built additional gates but also invested in some upgrades. Arrival is still a bit odd with long walks from gate to immigration counters in concourse B and with sometimes long queues. However airport staff is friendly and security is strict but done in a friendly manner. Overall a 3 to 4 stars in Europe. With improved intercontinental connections and one of the best intra-Europe network this airport has good potential to become even better and more attractive to travellers.
I use Brussels airport a lot and it is a good airport which has got better over the past couple of years. The cafes are good and not too expensive when compared with places like Heathrow. The train service should be improved though as it only accepts Belgian debit cards and normally only 1 machine works. As everyone is coming from abroad this doesn't make much sense.
A well run and well maintained airport with friendly and efficient staff. Frequent and reasonably priced train link into central Brussels. Didn't use the shops or catering so can't comment there. If your flight comes in at the far end of pier A then you're in for quite a hike to the train station/taxi pick up and the signing seems to fizzle out towards the end but otherwise a very good experience.
"The negative aspects are high prices in restaurants and car parking. Although there is a single terminal there are two departure areas - ""A"" for Schengen zone countries (i.e. no passport controls) and ""B"" for non-Schengen (including the UK and Ireland). Passengers travelling through area ""B"" have a far shorter walk to/from the 'planes. Flights occasionally arrive at area ""A"" from non-Schengen countries - this is usually when bus transfers are necessary (so that passengers have to pass through passport control). A good recent development are the direct trains from the airport to Leuven as well as Brussels. A little known bus link is the hourly De Lijn service 359 to/from Roodebeek Metro station - useful for the east side of Brussels."
Zaventem is good clean and friendly. The food is pricey. The train connection is excellent but the taxis are a crude rip off. We are stuck with the never-ending tunnel to terminal A but the terminal is nice when you get there. Do something about people parking on the forecourt. And bussing when you land is hateful time consuming and stressful.
"Improvement in cleanliness and staff. Smooth process for drop-off, security, frontier and boarding, fast baggage on belt at return. Smokers friendly airport. The food/ drinks in restaurants are expensive for Romanian standards, at least. "
"Nearly missed my plane, in spite of arriving at airport in good time. One of two Security Gates has to be chosen according to designated Departure Gate, but latter is not shown on screen in Departures Hall. Security itself was chaotic. I was ordered into a queue which took more than twenty-five minutes just to reach the scanning equipment (one man was observing two scanners at once). After my laptop was scanned, I was told to start it up and then turn it off, meaning even more time was lost. Passport control was slow: in total it took more than thirty-five minutes between entering security and entering the departure lounge, by which time my flight was closing."
We transferred from a TAROM flight to KLM and our experience was smooth. The facilities airside are two folded the last part of the pier with our boarding gate (12) was looking nice and modern the first part looked bit shabby and worn down seen the economic reality in Romania it was high standard. I can't make any statement about the landside but the transfer security was lacking proper English skills and it was hard to communicate and get what they wanted which gives you the impression that these people are rude. In fact they aren't if you look into their body language as well.
The worst airport I have been to. Early morning flight and airport was very busy. Several kiosks were not working and only one person there to help. She was very rude and not trying to help. Everyone kept telling us to go to someone else for help with boarding pass but could never talk to anyone. No one seemed to care that a large group of us were having a problem getting boarding passes. Lines for security were chaos. No one directing people and everyone just pushing in together. Terrible experience.
Quick friendly security screening. Short lines at passport control. However smoking areas not well controlled and was forced to breathe second hand smoke for 40 minutes sitting at my gate waiting to board my flight. I travel a lot and this is the only airport in the 15 or so years where I have ever experienced this.
A good airport. Very quickly through security which was staffed by polite people. Passport control queues small and staff dealt with all nationalities in a polite manner. Signs throughout the airport were found to be well positioned and also displayed in English. Over-all this a good airport.
Excellent airport very large friendly staff beats airports in France or Italy.
In general it is a normal airport. There are some shops places to sit etc. bathrooms are relatively clean. However I faced huge issues when I had to use the parking facilities. There is no gratis period for a car to come in and just pick you up for a very short period. This is very inappropriate because afterwards the only way to pay is in the local currency. EUR is not accepted anywhere and the exchange rates are very unfavorable. Moreover they did not accept to exchange small money (in my case 10 EUR). This caused a huge inconvenience for me and I have to say that the staff was not friendly either. I am definitely not keen on coming to this airport again!
It was not particularly busy when I arrived and departed but I felt Bucharest was one of the best airport experiences I have had in years. Apart from a short wait to check-in there were no queues anywhere and staff were courteous and friendly throughout. There is plentiful seating and a range of different food outlets (admittedly many selling similar food) and shops. A cheap alternative to a taxi is to use the bus into the city about every 20 minutes and a return ticket costs about 2 euros.
We started coming through here in December 2000. It's gone a long ways to finish what they started in the last 13 years but obviously by the other reviews still have a long ways to go in the pre-security departure lounge. However Lavazza is a nice touch because unlike the Starbucks model in which you have to help yourself and clean up your own mess the Lavazza is fastidiously serviced by wait staff who are very polite and attentive.
All the people I encountered in this Airport were friendly. It's not what I would say in the league of Singapore's Changi but nevertheless functional in design. Anyone though who has to spend more than 2 hours in the airport would be surely bored. Dining facilities are poor with the same saturated fat selection's. Taxi Fare to the airport from Bucharest Centre should be no more than 30 Leu. Avoid the taxi louts in arrivals or anyone who approaches offering this and that as you would anywhere. They will cost you a small fortune.
OTP in fact is two airports in one. The check-in hall the security controls and the passport control areas are old overcrowded messy and do not meet European standards. Once surviving this the departure hall is new and nice with many shops and bars. Especially in the morning it is suggested to arrive pretty early in order to get through the x-ray and passport controls: the queue is totally unorganized time consuming and stressful.
"Transferred in Bucharest coming from Paris to Oradea. OTP is a small airport quite modern. The issue is that I landed ""International"" in the new terminal had to walk (in a hurry because my transfer was tight) to the old domestic terminal to get my boarding card to find that the door was in fact at the new international terminal and walk back all the way! As there was only 1 line of luggage/passengers inspection open and not very fast that was really limit and I was lucky to board the bus on time. On the way back had some time to spend and could have a nice espresso and pastry in one of the bars. The international terminal is modern and clean but do not expect the facilities and free-tax of Singapore this is just a ""regional"" airport."
Well having recently traveled through Henri Coanda airport I found that there is not much before you go through security but when you are there is quite a few shops although for some unknown reason in duty free they will not accept the local currency which is the first airport I have come across that does not. In the international terminal is the Oasis self service restaurant I went to purchase a couple of drinks and I only had a couple of 100 Lei notes left the girl on the checkout went round other staff checking it was okay and not a forgery it was simply an unused note I was then asked to pay by card. I took the note back and changed it at a money exchange with no problem whatsoever and returned to pay for my drinks. When in the queue a passport control officer paid for his drink with no problem and when I mentioned it he was so rude but as I was going to go through to depart what can I say would I use this restaurant again definitely not. Would I return to Bucharest again probably not.
The usual mix of rude staff expensive food and poor signage. Not enough shops for a capital city airport.
One of the best small airports in Europe. You get in and out quickly and the addition of the new terminal still keeps it efficient. Staff are not overly friendly. Lines are short and there may not be a lot to do but that's fine since you never spend long here. Traffic to the centre is much improved but watch out for the taxi touts outside baggage claim.
I travel regularly to Bucharest and have been impressed by improvements made to this airport. It is clean directions are well signposted. If you use public transport it is cheap to travel into the City Centre by train or bus. The airport taxis are ok but watch out for taxi touts. To date I have had no problems with luggage on any of my trips through this airport and have had only friendly and efficient treatment by check-in and other staff. Coffee is expensive in the coffee bars though there are some coffee machines . Most facilities can be found here and security is clearly on view.
I was positively surprised by the changes that occurred in Henri Coanda Airport in Bucharest. Now it has a new terminal over 40 gates I believe and the duty free is actually open and it works. It still does not accept payment in Romanian Lei (only $US and Euros and potentially credit cards). It does look like a nice airport terminal now once you do the check-in. Before check-in it's still outdated.
I connected through OTP from Istanbul to Venice on TAROM. After disembarking all our plane's passengers were made to wait in a hallway unable to enter the main terminal for about half an hour. The guard in charge clearly did not know what to do with anyone. At length someone else showed up and simply opened a door letting everyone enter the terminal not requiring any documents. The gate for our connecting flight to Venice was changed several times -- each time with no notice. The only way passengers knew there had been a change was if they happened to look at the departure board and saw that the gate was different. I found OTP to be decades behind the rest of the world.
Arrival at Bucharest Baneasa awful experience. Building is too small to accommodate all arriving passengers. Departures are even worse shady unorganized looking terminal. Security check takes forever and is an inefficient process. Waiting area at the gates too small too accommodate passengers of one flight let alone if 2 flights leave at about the same time.
Arrived from Paris to Bucharest OTP. The Tarom plane was allowed direct access. Quite a long walk until you get to the passport control that went quick with Police Officers that have improved a lot since the past days. We were waiting at belt 1 for the luggage as shown on the screen when somebody noticed that our flight was no longer on this screen ! It had been moved to an other belt without notice. 2 days later flew from OTP to Cluj (internal flight) - check- in was quick and efficient waiting-room much too small with not enough seats boarding by bus. All in all not HKG or Singapore but better than some other European airports.
I was impressed by the speed of immigration on arrival and received a nice welcome from the officer checking my passport. Customs ignored me and I was out in less than 8 minutes in total. The bus journey into the city centre was -as everyone says- a nightmare. The only way to avoid it is to arrive late in the evening and take a taxi. The departure was different. There does not seem to be room for a queue and if you don't speak Romanian it can be hard to check if you are in the correct queue. Nevertheless it was all fairly friendly and I have seen worse at Heathrow!
Although it's only about 10 miles away from Bucharest traffic to and from the airport is a nightmare: depending on the time of day it takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to get there (also beware of incredible rip-offs with the taxis
Immigration quickly cleared and baggage quickly appeared. Travel into the city is a nightmare - the road network is wholly inadequate for a developing city. Check in for returning flight was quick with no queue but then very long wait at security probably due to heightened measures ahead of the NATO summit. Departure lounge comfortable if slightly basic but all outlets food and non-food very expensive. Range of food on offer very restricted - OK for a snack but not more (even if you could afford it). All outlets will accept EUR but do not seem to have change.
There are separate buildings for arrivals and departures. Arrived on easyjet (although they may be switching to Banesca which is altogether the poorer relation of the two airports serving Bucharest). Bussed to the terminal from the aircraft and immigration was swift as was baggage retrieval. Once outside I recommend you press on through the throng of taxi touts and either take the bus into town or a grab Fly Taxi cab and they will be at the head of the rank where their supervisor will get you organized. The meter only ticks when you are moving which is just as well as traffic can be heavy. There are cheaper and just as honest taxis but they either have to be phoned for or you need to seek them out at arrivals. Departing was a breeze security was pleasant but extremely thorough. Once through the formalities the shops are outrageously expensive compared to down town and whilst prices are displayed in euro local lei are readily accepted in the handful of cafes. Overall Otopeni is a small not very busy and clean facility surrounded by acres of apron and runway.
A surprisingly good airport in terms of efficiency. While check-in is becoming a bit more chaotic and takes longer due to increased traffic it still has one of the quickest check-in times for an airport in Europe. Arrivals are usually a breeze. I think the longest I've had to wait at passport control is 5 minutes and the longest for baggage 15 minutes. The building and services are in need of an upgrade but that's OK with me since it's easy to spend a minimum amount of time at the airport.
Overall a clean airport transfer from domestic to international flights very quick and bus connection very convenient. Airport personnel not smiling customs officers rude and do not speak English still not used to accept EEA/EU ID Cards and mix them up with other non-EU nationalities compared to Sofia Airport customs for example. A big smile is needed even if you are a customs airport officer to leave the country with a good impression.
Modern but quite small airport. Security and baggage efficient and quite quick. Travel between airport and city is horrendously slow - the road just can't handle the weekday traffic volume.
A rather small but clean new airport with modern facilities a good business lounge. Quite a number of shops which I didn't use
Bucharest airport serves it's purpose but it's nothing too exciting. Food outlets are very limited and overpriced there are also some overpriced shops in the departures area. It is a fairly small airport so moving through the airport is quick and easy. Transfers between Bucharest City and the This airport take about 20 - 45 mins. There are 2 methods of public transport between the city and airport. A bus which takes 40mins to 1 hour or a taxi which will cost about £3.00 - £6.00 or £8.00 if you get ripped off. Fly taxi is the only taxi company allowed to take passengers from the airport and their taxis charge twice the rate of the other taxi companies. I felt that it was worth me taking the time to provide this piece of information as there has been nothing written since last September so I hope that it is published and useful to others.
This is now a good clean modern and efficient airport - a pleasant surprise. When recently departing the airport seemed almost deserted so there is clearly room for a considerable increase in traffic. In short this could and should be a regional hub airport. In common with much of Eastern Europe smoking restrictions are less than in the West. I cannot comment on public transport access as I was collected by car. Traffic to/from the city centre can be busy (and some pretty erratic driving can be observed) so allow plenty of time.
I've use the airport several times over the last 8 years and have found a great improvement in it service. it's still not up to English standard but considering it past I feel it's doing very well with most of the facilities are friendly accessible and comparable and better in price to ours in England. Prices may fluctuate but there no worse than the very very high prices we can pay in our country if we allow the airports to rip us off.
The international airport at Otopeni has the international standard and is quite comfortable for a Romanian point of view. The building is clean and the ways are short as the airport is quite small. The weak points are the rude agents at the buffets in the departure hall and especially the rip-off taxi-drivers who wait for arriving passengers. It is recommended to hold the luggage firmly in the hands to avoid it getting loaded in the taxi faster than you can watch. Always negotiate the fare before entering/loading the taxi. Never pay more than 400.000 Romanian LEI (11 EURO) for Bucharest-City-Centre ! Normally they demand 600.000 LEI or even more. Avoid paying in Euro there are cash-dispensers and changing counters in the arrival hall. There is a good bus-link to the city (nr. 783) for only 10% of the taxi-price (37.000 LEI) that leaves every 30 minutes. Departure is downstairs in the arrival hall (no signs!) the stairs are close to the exits. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the bus in a nearly invisible shop-box outside of the building.
"Arriving at the airport at 4 a.m., we entered to check in, check our baggage. We saw one massive mob in front of the KLM counter area going all the way back to the entrance doors. The small, designated line for baggage drop off and boarding pass printing kiosks were not visible. No signage available. We asked a person in line where to start. They pointed to where the boarding pass kiosks were located. There were no crowd control stanchions to designate a line in front of each kiosk. Having no choice, we joined the mob slowly forcing their way towards the kiosks. 25 minutes later, we reached a kiosk. Check in process was slowed by long response times by the kiosk. After scanning our passports, later on we were asked if we had our passport. Really? Kiosk didn't know it had already scanned it. (What we were not told by our travel company, Viking, was could we have avoided this hassle by printing our boarding pass at the hotel.) 4:40 a.m., boarding passes in hand, we joined the other mob moving forward slowly to access a very short line with crowd control stanchions. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 6:10 a.m., would we make it? I got the impression the airport didn’t have a clue about crowd control, how to use more crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. At 5:20 a.m. we had our bags checked, headed to the security lines. Was shocked to see the security section had crowd control stanchions to manage long lines. Guessing the airport manager has never seen this, never actually gone on the land side the airport. Passing through security, we go right into a fancy, spacious, shopping area. Wow. Going through we reach the area to access departure gates. Was amazed at all the open space for retail sales, shops everywhere, no problem finding space for display racks, etc. No professional management, no crowd control, nothing. Airport managers must only live and work on the airside, never seeing the hassle passengers must go through. Best way to see the Budapest airport is from your plane's window as you fly out to the modern world."
Flying in was fantastic quickly through passport control but had to wait 50 minutes for our baggage. Terminal 2B is modern efficient and has great facilities. Oh how I miss T1 with its old world charm. Flying out was strenuous and a long process. Although we had checked in online we still had to queue for over an hour to get our bags checked leaving very little time to go through the ergonomically bad security again after a long wait. Still as typically Hungarian all staff are extremely polite and helpful. It was the amount of times we had to present our travel documents that become irritating. Hopefully the next time I fly into Ferihegy I will be staying in Hungary permanently.
Ferighegy Airport is a quite efficient clearly signed airport. On our arrival from Amsterdam we were directed to an escalator about 25 meters away from our arrival gate and within 20 minutes we were out of the airport and on our way to our Hotel. Seamless experience there. Leaving Budapest towards Bucharest with TAROM was a smooth experience as well the SkyPriority counters were completely free and we were checked in in a matter of minutes. As they were very strict with the FastTrack we chose for the standard lane as my wife has no Priority status and we did not want to separate there but the queue on this busy 8am was short and efficient and within a small 8-10 minutes we were security cleared. Another few steps in the terminal to the non-schengen departures which were deserted at the time of our departure. The boarding process via the bus (it was a small commuter plane) was less orderly there was a priority section in the bus but which was not enforced so the run to the plane was opened as soon as the bus opened it's doors. Further up for the smoker the cigarette prices are highly competitive and you can take two cartons when travelling within the EU per person.
Everything seemed to run pretty smoothly here and baggage arrived quickly. The handlers were quite efficient at getting missing bag to me after it arrived on the next flight. Departing there was about a 20 min queue at the Lufthansa check in but security was quite quick.
Travel here quite often. WIFI used to be unusable at all but things are progressing. The queueing is usually fast but you bet your shoes or only metal glasses will beep - most sensitive metal detector on earth. Personnel generally not pleasant given by culture. Forgot phone once on board nobody bothered much to help me and nobody ever called back despite they promised etc. From service point still lot to learn.
Great. Extremely clean facilities great food and great observation tower. The only minor blip was the queuing which took a while but its what I suspected would happen. Great airport would fly from there again.
"The airport terminal 2B is now comfortable and check in desks satisfactory. The worst thing is the long walk through a covered way but open to the elements so you can get soaked if wind and raining. You then have to stand for such a long time (once over an hour) in the ""cattle sheds"" which are baking hot in summer and your plane hasn't even arrived at airport. Once in this shed there are no toilet facilities or any seating. Hopefully this situation will be improved in near future."
When departing from here arrive 3+ hours before boarding - only one baggage wrapping point was available - we spent 30 minutes in the queue and could only pay by cash. No signage for the ATMs. Security lines were understaffed. There were only 4 safety lines working and it was very inconvenient to put on shoes after security check without a seat. Immigration was slow due to IT system problems. The rest of airport facilities we used like baggage drop-off overall air-conditioning cleanliness customs for tax refund the tax refund itself duty free shops were as expected. So in general the airport was rather a nervous disappointment - can do better.
The airport is very small and cramped. Terminal 2 is divided in two parts making it really small and uncomfortable. Queues are huge both at check-in and security. If not for the Skycourt after security and the maze-like duty-free it would really be claustrophobic with the lack of daylight being a real nuisance. The link to the city is very poor. The bus / metro combination is both uncomfortable and expensive making it impossible for you to reach the city center without a transfer. The entire terminal has only one exchange booth but most appalling wasn't their scarcity but the rate they're charging which was nothing short of a scam - welcome to Europe. Coming from Ukraine (IEV) the contrast was even more evident. Toilets weren't clean broken faucets soap lacking in many. Next - the Wi-Fi. BUD supposedly offers 2 hours of free Wi-Fi that is available once you get passed a lengthy security/rules agreement check-page that directs you then onto another useless page that given the speed takes ages to load. Even once passed those mandatory checkpoints the internet was still very slow and almost completely useless. Basically nothing good and I won't be looking forward to going back to the airport in the future. If not for the occasional offers to some places unserved from Belgrade (such as Kiev) it's really not worth the hassle.
Worst airport in the world. No smoking area in an international airport? Come on! What a joke! Even better when your flight is delayed 4 hours and there is no possible way to exit and re enter the terminal. Ridiculous.
The incoming flight (turn-around) was delayed by 1 hour due to technical problems and a replacement plane was used so our departure EasyJet flight (U28424) was also late to depart. This was an irritation but was not our main problem the problem was we were told on the electronic read outs that boarding had commenced only to walk a very long way to what was a metal out-building with no facilities no proper seating arrangement and as far as I could see no toilets and no air conditioning on a fairly hot day. We were forced to stand for some 30 minutes or more. The incoming flight had not touched down at this point. We stood there covered in sweat from the heat. As senior citizens we were not pleased with this arrangement. It was akin to herding cattle. This is the 21st century and Ferihegy were recently upgraded. Budapest Airport this should have been a better experience than this very poor! After complaining we received a well constructed (probably by a lawyer) standard letter more or less stating that this was the future low cost flying for keeping costs down for budget airlines. My interpretation is if you do not like it fly business class or at least book priority boarding. Not a good airport to fly budget anymore.
A rather disappointing airport. A beautiful city like Budapest sure deserves better. Terrible queues at border control and check-in. Lack of good shops and restaurants. Too little ATMs and currency exchange points. The building itself is rather small with nothing else to do but to sit and wait for the flight. Granted there's a free 120-min. Wi-Fi. The road to the airport is not a highway but a very narrow local route with lots of traffic lights and traffic jams on the way. With so many tourists coming in to Hungary they sure need to make significant improvements otherwise if the number of passengers increases dramatically the airport would be paralysed.
Flew in and out by Ryanair. Bussed to the terminal on arrival had to walk a long way to an out station shed for departure. Terminal is clean and modern worked very efficiently and has free WIFI. public transport too and from the airport is very efficient and cheap. I was very impressed.
I flew to and from this airport with Wizz air. After landing at Budapest we taxied to our remote parking spot. We where bussed towards the terminal. After going to the toilet (which was clean) I was really surprised to see my bag already on the luggage belt. When it was time to return we went to terminal 2B. We dropped the bag at the bag drop off counter. We walked to the security point. Everything went quickly and smoothly (approx. 10 min). The airport had a very nice food court and all looks very modern and clean. My overall impression of Budapest Airport was very good!
Good infrastructure bad management and poorly trained staff. Check-in doesn't open until exactly 2 hours before the flight (regardless of how empty the place is and/or how many passengers are waiting). Hand- luggage check is disorganized. All is over-sized and there is a lot of running around for nothing. Staff are too disinterested to change the lanes to fit the demand. Then there is the laughable shoes and belt off routine that has long been shown to be nonsense and abandoned by most airports. So overall keep the building get rid off the supervisors and start training the remaining employees.
Never seen anything like this. Passengers hauled into a tent to wait for boarding like cattle. No heating no sanitation. Shame on these people. I have a couple ideas for further improvements/cost saving: passengers should load their baggage onto the plane or passengers should push the plane on the runway.
"This is an interesting airport to say the least. We flew out of terminal 2B and it seems as though they ran out of money to completely renovate the entire terminal. Once past security where the bin helpers throw your bins onto the conveyor belt with no regards to what hand luggage you might be carrying you come upon a beautifully renovated terminal with nice seating areas and a good selection of restaurants. There is free wifi in the food court area and the bathrooms are pretty clean. But then you go to the gate area and its like you are going back to the 1970s. Even worse my gate did not have a ""real"" gate. We had to walk outside and then we were corralled into a big tent with only four pathetic heating lights in the entire thing. It's a real shame that the airport couldn't do a complete renovation of the terminal because it looked like it had so much potential to be nice."
Terminal 2 takes all flights but has no rail link to Budapest meaning a long bus ride or pricey taxi is the only way to get there. Arriving was fine apart from a ridiculously long queue at immigration despite us arriving from an EU nation. Return - Check in was alright a long queue but it seemed to go down quickly. Queuing at security was a shambles took longer to pass the tiny security hall than it did to check in. Duty Free was alright and the skycourt upstairs for food and drink is brilliant. I have a huge problem with the way they board aircraft's here - boarding 3 Jet2 flights (Leeds Manchester Edinburgh) through the same gate at the same time? Was an absolute shambles. An hour before the flight was due to depart we were told we were boarding through the gate walked down the jetway onto the airport tarmac walked across and into what can only be described as a tent - with 3 queues for each flight. No toilet facilities and no seating just standing room only. Waited in a freezing cold damp tent for half an hour then the doors were opened and all 3 queues boarded 3 identical aircraft - what a shambles. People were boarding the wrong plane and because of it we left 30 minutes late but thankfully made up for it in flight. For the major international airport of a capital city of a European Country this was a shambles. I've flown to Greek Island airstrips and had a better experience.
Terminal 1 closed in early 2012. T2 now takes all flights. It was refurbished last year and is spacious well organised and light. There are lots of good food options on the second floor. Shops are ok but overpriced. The main problem is accessibility as T2 is not served by a railway connection (unlike T1). There is a taxi service but it is a little pricey.
Airport has good bus links to city but you need to change at the end of the bus line onto the metro to finish your final leg to the city. No train link direct from airport. Bureau de Change always very busy so advisable to get your holiday money before you leave. Airport signage was slightly confusing (does an up arrow mean straight ahead or on the floor above?) but not to the point it would seriously disrupt you. Airport terminal 2B was well lit modern and had excellent facilities. Staff understood English well. In security lines very fast moving metal rolling bars move the trays along be warned.
Remember my stay here as smooth and a pleasure. Superb view of the airport from several spots which I appreciated. Ground crew put on viking helmets when the Norwegian Air Shuttle came in. Quite a small airport perhaps a bit too small which gives little options for food and other things you might want to purchase. Everything else
Arrived late in the evening speed through border control didn't have to wait for our luggage. But departed on BA from Terminal 2B what a disaster
Terminal 1 is the designated low cost terminal catering for Wizzair easyjet Jet2 Germanwings and Norwegian. It is small but has been nicely refurbished and contains everything you could need as both an arriving or departing passenger. Plenty of refreshment outlets and even an outside viewing area overlooking the apron which is free to visit if you need to kill a bit of time while you wait for your flight. Overall a very nice experience.
Arrived at Terminal 2. Bags arrived very quickly. Taxi service to the centre is well organised fixed price (depending on zone) and not expensive (and discount card for fixed price back to the airport). Check-in on departure is well-organised and efficient. Boarding cards issued online or by machine at airport (with someone to help with machines) - the desks only receive baggage. We checked in online to choose seats but did not complete because we did not have access to a printer. Got the boarding passes from the machine at the airport but with the seats we had chosen online. Very smart departure area. Paid to go in the Malev business lounge (EUR 16 each) which was well worth it.
The No Entry or No Stop restriction at the arrival curbside of Ferihegy 1 and 2 airports is below any international standard of civilised travel. As a result arriving traffic has moved up to the 2A/2B Departure curbside making departure twice as congested as it should be. The overpriced parking lots are empty so are the overpriced taxis (parking without passengers) in the arrival area.
Booked with Malev AMS-BUD-IST with a transfer time of 45 minutes far too short. A very long line-up to exit the EU with few customs officials impossible! Several people missed their connecting flight. Very frustrating and inefficient system. Officials unable to help those who were missing their connecting flights. Beware while traveling through BUD on a short transfer!
Arrived at this airport from Amsterdam. I was in the city within 90 minutes from the time of arrival. Staff at information counter not friendly and not happy with the job she is doing. The public transportation from or to the city was average but worked fine. I bought the 72 hours travel card (works on metro trams and buses) from the airport's post-office. The cheapest way to get to the city is by bus 200E from the arrival bay to the nearest metro station Station Kobanya-Kispest (M3) on the blue line. On the departure day at Terminal 2 Malev check-in agent and BUD's KLM staff were both polite and helpful. From check-in counter until clearing the security check point took less than 15 minutes although the airport had a busy period in the afternoon. Did not make any buying at the duty-free outlet due to tight waiting time for my departure. The airport seems clean. The only complaint is the airport has insufficient seating at departure area.
Terminal 2 for transferring. Nice and clean airport. Because of change between Schengen and non-Schengen area a brisk walk from one wing of the terminal to another but not really a problem after just sitting in the airplane. Going out from Schengen there is no safety check coming inside there is. Restrooms a bit hard to find.
Very new and bright at departure area but the arrival area is really dark and dated. Bus door to door service is really good with reasonable price. Security staff are not friendly not pleasant experience. They are trying to improve the services but still long way to go.
I was pleasantly surprised : no queues at check in no queues at security. As regards arrivals nothing changed yet but everything worked properly. Overall a very pleasant experience.
Arrival into terminal 2B is great - departure is another thing. Check in is a bit of a mess with the counters being opened two hours before hand and no real queue system in place. Security is very thorough - I was practically stripped searched - but no real problems - something you have to put up with these days. Biggest problem is signage - or lack of. Trying to get your tax back is fun and you need a lot of patience. Otherwise not a bad airport some good food places but on the steep side.
If you are flying with a no frills airline chances are you'll be using Terminal 1. This is a very cramped terminal and you really don't want to be spending much time here. Having said that the Duty Free shop is fine and for the smokers you'll be able to stock up on very low priced cigarettes. The terminal is very stuffy and far too warm but you will find two refreshment areas.
Taxis to/from airport very expensive public transport difficult. Travelling with pushchair in Budapest is a nightmare guess this is true for wheelchair users to. Baby changing facilities are rubbish : one table one mat and one chair. No picures or colours on the wall no toys. Cleanliness is ok. Restaurants are expensive. T1 (Low cow cost airlines) Spent 45 minutes queing at check in. Getting through the gate was not difficult as we got priority with the baby. T2 (other airlines) A town called Vecsas is close so anyone can do a late shopping (pharmacy shops). Arriving is much smoother and faster no hassle and queue at passport check.
You need to arrive at least 2 hours in advance 3 if you like to be on the safe side. This airport is much too small (extension works on-going). There are only 5 booths open for all Malev Economy flights and the queue is terrible. They urge you to use the self-checking screens but you have to queue anyway to leave your luggage. Attendants do their best. When you are at least out of this queue you are in for a second one for the safety check which is aslo vastly undersized. Not much in term of shops or drinking/eating. The number of seats available at the gates is ridiculous. then you have the luck to board by Bus. I hope their future extension will be well designed because for the time being it is not an airport you want to use.
There were incredible queues at check-in and even longer ones at security check. We spent an hour and a half in the queue to pass the security checks without any kind of order. Moreover the staff at security check rude and hardly communicate in English. We really feel treated more like animals than as people.
This airport is a nightmare both at check in and security. It took us 2 hours and this only because we sneaked under the barriers to avoid missing our flight which as it happened was delayed by over an hour anyway. Avoid if at all possible.
This airport has been downgraded by EU authorities because of security issues. Had to wait long for Star Alliance check-in (I had my sport bike). Schengen terminal 2 only 1 x-ray machine attended with enormous queuing. BUD-FRA-BRU in FRA they made again a full security check even checked my shoes and said Budapest now is a 3rd world airport sorry for inconvenience. So stressful and quite abusing.
Arrival at Ferihegy is a bit deceiving. The direct train to the city is a joke the station lies in the vicinity of low-cost Terminal 1 while most of passengers arrive at Terminal 2 which is connected with T1 and the railway station by public road usually congested with urban traffic. At the remote railway stop there are no amenities for disabled passengers and no information at all. The real nightmare is the departure and transit. Taken into account incredible queues at check-in and then even longer queues at security check you should come to the airport well ahead the time the airlines suggest. Staff at security check is harsh and rude and hardly communicate in English. Due to the lack of space and insufficient number of gates in the Schengen terminal the crowds of passengers make it difficult to move not to say about places to seat. The only positive thing you see are the posters and leaflets saying how wonderful spacious and friendly the airport will be in future when the construction of new terminal is completed.
Arrived at the airport terminal 2A and got a shock to see the unbelievable huge crowd at Star Alliance check-in. The end of the row was at the entrance of the airport. Seems LH and AUA don't really care of this situation weeks ago I was waiting 25 minutes for drop-off in the same time. I will think twice to use Swiss if check-in will be pooling into a big maze. Security improved a lot not waiting for long and they were friendly. Airside hard to find any free place to sit down on that Saturday afternoon restroom was clean. Many announcements were not clearly understandable thus I nearly miss my flight.
T2B. Prompt passport control (non-EU national) but baggage was slow. Travelling out : a 15min BA check-in queue but aggravated by 20 minutes to get through a crowded security area. The extension of T2 now underway is well overdue. In terms of landside access a ticket for the 200E bus can be purchased from the newsagents but to get a 3day or 7day pass you need to get to the underground station at Kobanya-Kispet. This is a nuisance as it should be possible to get these tickets at the airport. However can recommend the hotel shuttle service for timeliness and value-for-money.
I have just had enough of the way check-in staff feel they can treat passengers at Ferihegy. I am not sure why repeatedly I get talked at as if I am an unwelcome alien. The only time I saw any personnel smile was when security found a jar of Slovak mustard and lobbed it into the bin happily. While I don`t object to this being termed a liquid if it must be I was rather surprised to say the least to hear the security guard a woman make a negative remark about me in Hungarian assuming I could not understand I think. I'll be flying into another airport when going back to Hungary.
Passed through BUD Terminal 2B 12 times in the last half year. Check-in usually takes a bit of time and can be extremely crowded so it is good to be there 90 minutes before your flight - except if you have already checked in online. Check-in staff not especially nice or helpful. There is only 4 check-in machine for Malev flights however this is their main hub and those machines are usually out of order or frozen for several minutes. Passing security takes time and they can also be rude. The airside is crowded with good facilities but only a few place to sit - let's hope that this will change with the current enlargement of the terminals. After boarding at peak times we often had to wait 5-10 minutes for the personnel of the airport to push back the plane from the standing position: there is not much capacity reserve for this at BUD. When arriving getting your luggage can take 5 minutes as well as 25 you should just cross your fingers and wait. I miss a central screen in the baggage reclaim area which would show which flight is delivered on which belt.
Terminal 2B. Arrival waited 20 minutes for baggage but apart from that quickly through immigration. Departure check in area very crowded but checked in took about 10 minutes through security in 5 minute. Departure lounge good with good food outlets.
"Aerolineas Argentinas' departure terminal is primitive and chaotic. Instead of everyone standing in one check-in line and being served by the next available agent, you stand in line by flight. The lines snake through the building and there is no one to tell you what you are supposed to do. The check-in area was dirty and overcrowded. Our gate was at a beautiful, new part of the airport with a few services. But, getting there from check-in is stressful and very unpleasant. The road to the airport was strewn with burned cars from rioting over power failures during the heat wave. I don't recommend this airport, but if you are flying international, it is your only option."
A nice airport: Convenient for city good flight arrival and departure displays. Relaxed atmosphere. Rapid and straightforward security. Security people pleasant and helpful. Decent range of places to buy food. Clean toilets Plenty of seats in gate area. Bus ride to and from plane (if needed) short. Bags arrive quickly. Taxis outside airport well organized.
Much improved infrastructure relative to my previous visit February 2011. Immigration (passport control) took 15 minutes despite huge lines (at least one other large international flight clearly landed just before ours from ATL). 32 passport control lines all staffed (why doesn't the US do this?). Another 5 minutes to send luggage through X-ray at customs. That's the time to nip over to Banco National to get Argentine currency at good exchange rate. Easy and convenient to get taxicab to center of city at kiosk in center of arrivals hall. Leaving spent 15 seconds in outgoing passport control. Both entry and exit passport control officers actually smiled!
I flew from EZE last Wednesday to Mexico with Turkish Airlines connecting in Sao Paulo. New Terminal is just bright and happy with nice bars and cool duty free shops. Star Alliance VIP is nice and offers a lot it looks like a furniture show room but it does the job. I made connection in GRU then Panama and finally Mexico and EZE is by far the nicest airport nor the biggest or the easiest. Overall really nice experience.
Arrived from LHR at 0830 after 13hr flight non stop with BA. Immigration queue was OK took about 20 mins which meant our luggage was waiting on the carousel. Then it all went haywire. Air France Iberia Lufthansa and Alitalia flights all arrived within an hour of ours so imagine about 1000 people plus suitcases trying to get through customs. 6 lines all formed in a very haphazard way which then moulded into 4 lines for 4 x-ray machines. This took us an hour to get through and into arrival hall. Another 90 mins standing there while our holiday reps organised coach transport. International Terminal A and the surrounding roads can't cope at peak times for all these arrivals. Our departure was much smoother I'm pleased to say. Luggage drop off fine security queue took about 10 mins passport control about the same. Stayed in the LAN lounge which is close to our departure gate (10). The departure lounge is modern I hope they do something about the Arrivals hall which leaves a lot to be desired.
It's been almost 2 years since the last time I used this airport and a lot has changed since. My flight - JFK via GIG arrived at gate 2 located in a very dated sector of terminal A. I know this part of the airport is scheduled to undergo improvements it really needs it but it looks like they've already started and some changes can be seen already like the new passport control area with many more passport desks located in the ground floor and brand new carrousels that replaced the very noisy old ones. Even so baggage claims still looks dated. I arrived at noon so passport control took less than 10 minutes. When I got to baggage claim my bags were already on the carrousel. Since every piece of luggage must be screened at customs there was a long line and it took me around 30 minutes to clear customs. The arrivals hall hasn't changed a bit - old and dark not the most welcoming. I got to the airport 4 hours prior to my flight because I was flying with a puppy. The check-in hall of terminal A is modern and very bright. Check-in was pretty quick and they let me check my bags and check the kennel with the puppy later. TAM Airlines personnel were kind and helpful as well as airport's employees. There was no line for security but there was a very long one for passport control - 30 minutes or more. I checked the screens and found out that my flight was already boarding at gate 10. Sadly I had to rush through Ezeiza's lovely free-shop in order to get to the gate on time. Gate 10 is located in a new building that replaces the old terminal B with very nice boarding areas great views of one of the runways and new concessions like Starbucks and Quilmes (Argentina's most famous beer). I didn't have time to wander through this new area that houses gates 8 to 23 but it looks spacious and pretty nice.
Took just under an hour in the PM rush hour from downtown to EZE but the taxi arrived about 15 mins late due to tie up in microcentro. United told us to give 3 hours but they opened their desks 30 minutes late resulting in line ups. Excellent Global Alliance Gold check in economy looked efficient as well. It took just 30 minutes to get through security and immigration. More efficient than US. Airside very limited United lounge OK.
Airport personnel very bad long lines for emigration and customer. The terminal facilities are not good there are too many free shops in areas where should be only for passengers after you arrive and pass emigration you have to go through a free shop in order to get the baggage claim sector.
The main problem of EZE airport are queues. Several times I had to wait more than half an hour to pass immigration control (both on departure and arrival). Waiting times for check-in security control and customs control on arrival are only slightly better. Other issues are totally overpriced duty-free shops. Prices are crazy.
Used EZE on a resent trip to BAires and was pleasantly surprised. Travelling on Air France and although the plane parks at Terminal C you actually arrive into Terminal B. The line for immigration can be long but just make sure you are in the right one. When I was there the line for Argentines was much longer than the non- Argentine one. Staff at immigration and customs were professional. Once through to land-side things can be a little hectic. On Departure Air France use Terminal C which is brand new. Immigration was fast and friendly. Terminal C has two places to eat a large Duty Free area and a few smaller stores. It does not however have a currency exchange facility so I would recommend changing most of your Pesos before leaving for the airport.
This is a very nice clean and functional airport. It is not anything elaborate but it gets the job done and is miles ahead of other South American airports. The lines for check-in with TAM were quick and the security checkpoints and passport control were fast and efficient. The gates in Terminal A are spacious with plenty of seating and the terminal has good signage in both Spanish and English. A very pleasant experience overall.
I had no problems arriving in or leaving Ezeiza
I arrived almost five hours prior my flight thinking I would have time to shop and eat dinner. It took me up to 2.5 hours to check in to AA. The airport was crowded. There was a strike on the way to the airport and many people came late. After that almost 1.5 hours to pass security line. There are some nice stores in the duty free. The airport is small considering the volume of passengers and old but well maintained.
Arrived almost 3 hrs before my flight. I was flying First Class so it only took 20 mins to check my bags I probably would have missed my flight if I'd been in general check-in. The line for security stretched halfway through the terminal. It was a little more than 30 mins to the ID check. Once through that there was another long queue to get through security - of the 5 lanes only 3 were open and took 45 mins to clear. Customers took another 30 mins to clear. That left just enough time for a quick stop in the American lounge before our flight was announced.
I found it a very good experience and better than many airports in the UK. There are two terminals. A is new clean and used by international airlines. B is old and (I believe) only used by some Aerolineas Argentinas flights. Arriving in terminal A I was outside having collected my bags in 30 minutes. Checking in opened 4 hours before the flight and I was through quickly. Departing it was all very organised and what appeared long queues at passport control and security went very quickly 5 minutes maximum. Some tips (partly covered already). On arrival best rates for exchange are at Banco Nacional. There is a desk in the luggage hall if this is closed then exit the arrivals channel completely and take two turns to the right. Much better rates than elsewhere. Taxis ignore all the spivs hanging around and go to Taxi Ezezia desk in the middle of the floor when you exit arrivals. 150 pesos to city centre including tolls. On departures there is very little once airside however there are several cafes landside including a McDonalds with an outside terrace. This is a good place to sit and watch events outside the terminal incessant hooting whistling etc which of course everyone ignores. I watched an amusing episode where two people cut each other up got out and hugged/chatted then cut each other up again trying to exit the drop off zone. Airside I found perfume to be cheap but everything else relatively expensive by local standards.
This airport is a nightmare. Immigration control can take up to 1h 30min like it happened to me. It just needs 2 planes arriving at the same time. Customs procedure the same. Leaving the country is no different but worse. Make sure you arrive in time for check-in and passport control especially in the evening when many intercontinental flights depart. I recommend at least 2h before departure. Duty-free area is good for South American airports and good prices.
Unlike other reviews I found EZE a fairly unpleasant experience. The boarding gate areas were almost always crammed and stressful places. The terminal seems to have very few good shops and poor information on arriving flights. In fact no information was available for arriving flights on any monitors I could find. I was looking to see how delayed my colleague's flight was on an arrivals monitor but cound not find one anywhere including the American Airlines- One World Admirals Club lounge (although the staff there were very helpful). Another reason for referring to arrivals monitors is to assess how honest the departures monitors are - eg: if the arriving aircraft from a certain airline is running many hours late it would be unlikely if its associated departing flight was on time. I found the general staff overly officious the business lounges incredibly small and crowded (don't use the Iberia One World Lounge - it reminded me of a very small regional airport lounge in Australia) and the restaurant and food outlets extremely limited. In winter poor foggy weather can cause major flight delays so be prepared!
I arrived and departed from EZE. To fully enjoy this airport you really have to like waiting in line. Upon arrival you have to wait in line at immigration which is normal at most international airports. However when you depart you have to wait in line at the check-in as the check-in kiosks aren't common at EZE yet. In addition you have to wait in line for passport control and of course security. The security check is fairly thorough but they only have a few stations which causes huge line ups. I really appreciated the smoking room in the departure level as well as the pretty large duty free shop. When you depart from EZE in the evening you need to leave for the airport on time. The trip from downtown Buenos Aires can easily take 1.5 to 2 hours during rush hour. The public transport to/from the airport is adequate.
I wish more airports offered the excellent Customer Service that Aeropuertos Argentinas does at Ezeiza with fully manned desks and helpful staff. During my trip this month I ran into delayed flights cancelations and even a strike by Aerolineas Argentinas staff. Speaking little Spanish I couldn't have managed without this superb organization. I have used them on arrival to have porters available as my wife and I can no longer handle heavy luggage.
EZE has been upgraded over the years and arrival experience is much better than before. Luckily arrived this time at 1130 with TAM and into an almost empty immigration hall. It can be chock a block when several flights from Europe / USA arrive at once but my worst wait was no more then 30 minutes. Baggage claim straightforward. A word to the uninitiated - do not consider changing money in the arrivals hall or area immediately outside other than at the Banco de la Nacion. BNA offered usd $1 for ARS $390 the going rate. I saw the other places offering $330. Taxi Ezeiza (safereliable and prepaid at the kiosk ) is ARS $118 into town but only ARS $88 for the return. Do not consider a verbal offer from anyone in the arrivals area. Departing processes are straightforward again depending upon time of day and the Duty Free shopping is quite good. Toilet facilities airside could do with modernisation but are clean.
Arrived 3 hours prior to international flight and no queues at check-in but then it was a 2 am flight. Little security at xray but we found out why later. As we arrived at 10pm the few shops were shutting. Old sparse seating which was shiny with dirt. nothing to do except eat in a small expensive restaurant which was totally out of place. Went to board flight and got our bags emptied by stupid desk clerks who thought they knew what they were doing (explains lack of previous security desk clerks cheaper than security who might actually know what they are doing). Made us drink all water before getting on plane despite policy of allowing beverages on a plane that have been purchased after security (didnt make people drink alcohol!). Took my anti-bacterial handgel off me as said it was flammable pointed out global pandemic (and flying Aerolineas Argentinas it is essential!) she stated there was no pandemic any more! Couldn't be bothered arguing the point of alcoholic drinks and flammability. Other terminal is slightly better but only arrived there and out again. Baggage area is small but getting a taxi to hotel easy but dont go with luxury cars in immediate arrivals go to taxi desk in arrivals hall cheaper and very efficient set price too so no nasty surprises.
Late evening check in for my FRA bound flight took 3 minutes. This is a remarkable fact since this is prime time at EZE airport with many long haul flights departing for SE Asia the Americas and Europe. No need any more to go to another window to pay the mandatory airport tax which saves some minutes/hassle. This is included in your fare if ticket has been purchased after March 2009. No queues/delays at security. Even when at least 100 people where waiting in line for passport control it took no more than 10 minutes in an ever moving queue since all 20 booths were manned and moving fast. Take that Miami airport! Inside the terminal relaxed feeling due to its spaciousness public areas etc.
I have flown in and out of EZE a handful of times in the last couple of years as I have family in Argentina and cannot remember any problems. Ok there were horrible queues once as I was departing and not a lot of places for sitting down the cafes are getting expensive but other than that I'd say it's good. I have flown Iberia and TAM so not sure if that's part of the equation. I would agree that Tierra Leon is good for transport to and from the airport but if there's two or more adults you get a taxi for the same price. (Tierra Leon don't charge for two year olds and indeed free transfer from where they stop in the city to Retiro from where you can catch a long distance bus- and these are good! Can get one leaving a few hrs or sooner after you get there for a decent price!) In fact long distance coach travel all over South America is good in my experience but that belongs under a different topic obviously.
"I was dreading returning to the States via the Buenos Aires Airport after reading the reviews. While the airport is inefficient and the processes disorganized the actual experience was not as horrible as I thought it would be. I think I got there just before the big crush of people for the evening flights back to the States which undoubtedly helped. My advice: It's a waste of time to check in on-line for a Delta flight. The Delta staff insist on printing boarding passes and just won't accept the on-line version. Contrary to what you may hear there are no automated check-in machines at the airport. I was told there were 2 for Delta - there are actually none. Security is convoluted and not reassuring. You go through luggage ""security"" prior to getting in line to get your boarding pass at the main passenger desk. I saw no value in the process but they dig out the paper print out they have for your reservation and hand it to you to take with your luggage to the desk. Fortunately the check-in line was short but had lengthened by the time I finished. You get your boarding passes at the main desk and they check in your checked baggage. No problem with this part of the process and my luggage arrived just fine at JFK. You next pay your $18 tax to exit Argentina. The tax booth is now in the middle of the international airlines main passenger service area so very convenient. Less than 5 minutes but again the line had grown and I think I just lucked out. There was a tax window upstairs as well but it didn't look staffed. You next fill out your immigration form and take it your receipt for your tax payment and your carry-on baggage to go through Security. One station operating and over a 100 people in line. But don't worry it's not very thorough so the line moves quickly - less than 30 minutes. Fast but not a feeling of confidence. You find your departure gate after walking through an expansive duty- free area - don't bother buying water at this point as they won't let you take it through the next security check. You clear a mini-security as the final step prior to boarding. Very quick - line again moves quite fast. If you need to leave gate area to use bathroom you have to re-clear this security check. But it's fast. Refund of VAT - I didn't go through this process as I didn't buy much so I can't comment. Overall I found the people friendly and helpful - the entire process took about 1 hour 15 minutes but I believe that if you arrive at 7 or 8pm the process could take the 3 hours you read about."
Flew in and out December - January to and from Europe. I was prepared for a hard time in an airport which has not attracted good (or even adequate) reviews but it was not too bad. Upon arrival (mid morning) my only comment would be that Immigration was heavily overloaded although they did their best to process us as fast as possible. Luggage delivery time was quite reasonable. We arrived early for departure having read all of the comments about delays - it took us about 45 mins to check in pay our tax and get through security and immigration. I think this time could be very much longer at peak times since the queue snaked a long way at a reasonably quiet time of the day.
I have flown into and out of Ezeiza several times in the last 2 years. I just arrived in BA yesterday and the immigration baggage claim and customs area seem to have been re-done and are a lot more efficient. I enjoy the fact that you can duty-free shop entering Argentina! Departure is less organized but I check in using the business class queue (American Airlines) which usually takes only 10-15 minutes at the worst (the economy queue is always very long). Taxi Ezeiza is always a safe bet for transport into the city a kiosk right in the center of the floor when you exit customs. They are fast and efficient at a published rate that is always cheaper than the remises (and they offer a cheaper rate from the city to EZE - call to make an appointment when you leave).
I've traveled through EZE a couple of times in the last month. Arrival is no problem and I had no problems getting a reasonably cheap taxi to the centre from the kiosk outside the terminal. Where EZE is lacking is at check in. I've checked in on different occasions for flights to the US with Delta and to Europe with Lufthansa. In both cases I arrived with a good 3 hours to spare and had to queue for at least 1.5 hours to check in for Economy. In both cases the queue snaked outside the roped off area and down the terminal! They really need more staff and more open check in desks for Economy. With less than 1 hour to boarding there was till a massive queue for a 747 flight - which ended up leaving late. Don't forget you have still to queue to pay airport tax security screening and passport check So arrive early folks!
Most comments are concerning EZE the international airport outside of town. The domestic airport near the city center is smaller and simpler but relatively modern with plenty of dining options. Do beware of theft: my digital camera was stolen from next to me when my back was turned. There was no place to report this within the security area (woman at the info desk suggested I look for someone outside of security and when I later at another airport asked an Aerolineas Argentinas rep about asking whether a camera had been turned in she essentially said kiss it goodbye). Back at EZE one point is that the most obvious money exchange places as you exit give the lowest rates. The national bank branch giving the best rates is outside of security and a couple of turns to the right. Not at all obvious. Ditto on taxis: those easiest to find are very pricey. For cheaper ones you need to hunt a bit outside.
"Buenos Aires airport can be somewhat frustrating but compared to transiting through Washington Dulles en route to Canada it is a breeze. Upon arrival it takes some time in the queue to clear Immigration. You will be given a copy of your Immigration declaration put this away somewhere safe as you may be asked for it on departure. However the real problem  unless you can carry your baggage manually is the shortage of luggage carts. They are provided free of charge but there just aren't enough of them. I had to wait 30 minutes before airport staff finally arrived with some but friends who arrived later never did get one and had to man-handle their luggage to Customs. If you do have to wait for a cart you can use the opportunity to exchange US dollars at the bank that is adjacent to the Customs exit area - it's the one that airline staff use and they give a fair exchange rate. Clearance through Customs posed no problems once I got a cart but if you are taking a taxi downtown be extremely cautious. Do not under any circumstances accept the offer of taxi touts outside the airport offering to get you a cab - you can get badly burnt. Use only those yellow cabs parked at the official rank which you will see on exiting the airport. When leaving the best bet is to book a ""remise"" - a car that will pick you up and charge a pre agreed amount. In my case it cost 70 pesos from downtown to the airport. Airport departure procedures are more complex and frustrating than arrival. First you need to queue to obtain a boarding pass and the time this takes seems to vary from day to day. I went through in about 15 minutes but my friends took far longer than that. Next if you are going to claim a tax refund on purchases you will need to queue at the Customs booth - same ground floor level as the airline desks - to get your tax forms (the ones provided by the stores where you made your purchases) stamped. Next go upstairs to the tax refund office and queue once more to obtain your refund. This should not take more than 10 minutes. You will have the option of immediate payment in Argentine pesos or dollars which can be credited to a credit card. I took the cash as I will be returning to BA again. Next you have to queue once more to pay your airport departure tax - adjacent to the tax refund office. This can be paid in US dollars ($18.00) the equivalent in pesos or by credit card. When this is done you will go through initial screening next to the airport tax counter. Once inside you will next have to queue to pass Immigration. There is a form that has to be filled out - available at airline check-in desk - and you may possibly also be asked for the Immigration form you were give when arriving. Once this is done you are basically done until boarding time whan your hand luggage will be manually examined prior to boarding. To be sure of getting through all these procedures on time one should allow 2 1/2 hours to be on the safe side. And best eat before leaving for the airport as there is nothing much available at the airport in the way of food."
I connected from SCL to ORD via EZE. I concur with the comment that prices are obscenely expensive. I bottle of soda was 7.50 Arg. pesos. There is really only one place to eat after security in the international (non-AR) terminal. There's a fair amount of shopping but food and beverage options are very limited.
EZE airport is clean modern european style. Only downside is that the it is extremely expensive the prices are too much It seem that the airport operator has a monopoly and they control all the shops. I loved the airport the people and the city but that the prices are too much.
My wife and I took the Manuel Tienda Deleon coach from the airport to Buenas Aires last Wednesday. Some 20 minutes after we were dropped at our hotel I received a phone call to my room from the Manager of the coach company. It seems the driver had noticed that I had inadvertently given him $100 along with the $10 tip I had intended. He immediately returned to the hotel with the $100. Let's say I was a very happy camper and very impressed with the driver's honesty. A great first impression of Buenas Aires.
I visit Buenos Aires 2 or more times per year and while the city remains great Ezieza Airport is becoming more of a mess each time I visit. In all fairness arrivals are usually OK - in January I deplaned went thru Immigration claimed my bags and was on my way within 30 minutes. Try that in Chicago or JFK ! Now for the bad news: departures are a disaster - I would recommend arriving 3 hours early even if flying First/Business Class. I took nearly an hour to get checked in for a Business Class passenger then you pay the airport tax and head upstairs to security (a breeze) and Argentine Exit Stations (slow) . Boarding Areas are filthy and feature broken down chairs! A final cursory search of your hand luggage occurs at boarding - then you have an 8-11 flight back to the USA. What a mess.
I was trying to find a parking spot for more than 70 minutes in the only small enclosed parking and finally I left to park outside. Can't believe an airport with that traffic and weather don't have a covered parking area for people who would like to pay for it. Really bad service.
Excellent option travelling from Toronto Canada. Quick drive to apt check-in is a breeze as only single flight scheduled at desk smaller aircraft means smaller line-ups everywhere. Security was thorough but very quick - no rush no herding. Apt is spacious enough to handle the crowd. No walking endlessly. Collect baggage and walk out to the outside in a minute. The ride to the apt from Toronto is not at all bad allow 2.5 hrs travel time door to door from the middle of Toronto. Will always be my only choice for North American travel. Food options not much air-side.
K George is right on the money. As we were getting our things out of our car for our flight the Parking Shuttle guy patiently waited for us and helped more than most do. We flew out on Southwest and in on US Airways. Buffalo works well for SW as there is very little time wasted for taxiing so planes can get in and get out quickly. The airport is bright and easy to use. Be advised that the Jetway does not get lowered for regional jets so if its a rainy day and you are on a CRJ or ERJ to BUF have a newspaper handy to hold over your head!
BUF is a great smallish airport to fly into and out of. Security moves quickly the lines are short and it's very convenient for pick-up/drop-off and rentals. Upon arrival you can literally be in your car with baggage within 20 mins. Parking is expansive and cheap and there are always friendly drivers ready to pick you up at your car or drive you to it after arrival. The airport itself is bright and inviting- very well designed. It is also large enough to have a pretty good selection of flights- there are about 30 or so gates and probably a dozen or so airlines. You can't always get a direct flight but the options are not bad at all. My only gripe is there are only a few restaurant choices but since BUF is rarely a changeover it's not somewhere you'll usually spend a lot of time anyway.
Buf appears to be a nice little airport with friendly staff who are very efficient and treat customers with respect. The downside being airside shops and restaurants facilities are rather poor compared to other airports. The airport waiting areas are not too bad and gates quite near to each other. Quite a pleasant airport to fly into and out of.
I live in the Niagara Region on the Ontario Canada side and grew up in the Buffalo area. At one time it was common for Americans to trek to Toronto in order to obtain the best selection of flights at reasonable prices. Buffalo used to have three ancient small terminal buildings very limited parking and a small cartel of airlines operating out of it. Since the new airport in Buffalo has been built the range of airline choice and scheduling has grown and prices have fallen. Toronto on the other hand with its growth and congestion has become increasingly more expensive and although the drive from here is barely more than an hour that's hypothetical because traffic is always so bad in TO then if that's not enough parking is a nightmare you have to walk great distances to get to and inside of the terminals and now regardless of where you want to fly to it's much more expensive even after taking exchanges into consideration. We can leave our home be at Buffalo- Niagara in less than 45 minutes parking is plentiful and cheap but because it's such a hassle-free trip it's never any problem to get someone to do a drop off. You can just get in and out of there fast. I do agree the security barriers were placed in the most awkward part of the airport severely limiting the access to more shops and restaurant choices. The baggage carrousel area is also a bit tight when a few flights arrive at once but again these are small problems compared to the ease and reasonable prices. And for domestic flights within the US when you live in Canada you can entirely avoid customs when arriving and just drive from the airport and do your declarations at whatever bridge and it's so much easier. It's nice to be in this area and have the choice of airports - to include Hamilton which is making travel within Canada easier for us in this region.
Like some of the other reviewers here I'm a Canadian that uses BUF as an alternative to Toronto Pearson International. The reason is simple - - for flights within the United States it's vastly cheaper to fly from Buffalo -- On one occasion recently I was able to make a flight out of Buffalo for literally half what it would have cost from Toronto (all taxes included). Two significant reasons why Buffalo is cheaper -- Firstly Pearson charges possibly the highest landing fees in the world and second the United States TSA charges higher security fees for trans-border versus U.S. domestic flights. One review of Buffalo Airport complained about it being hard to fly anywhere direct from Buffalo but I suspect that most airports are like that these days. With one connection you can get to most places from Buffalo. My one issue with the airport is that it was designed in the pre-9/11 era and nearly all the airport facilities (stores restaurants etc.) are in the secure area so there isn't much to do for people waiting for arriving flights.
Southwest and Jet Blue offer a cheap alternative to us Canadians but airport fees at YYZ adding 80% to a fare is somewhat of an exaggeration. This airport is not a travel friendly place one of the coldest and most impersonal airports I have ever been in. The parking system is quite expensive and very disorganized the shuttle buses wander aimlessly and don't pick up on a first come first served basis. The day we left there were noisy sirens and alarms going off all the time and all the staff just ignored them and my eardrums just hummed and I couldn't hear anything that was going on. While the food sold was good there was very little selection (apart from Burger King before security every outlet had the same menu) and the prices were exorbitant.
BUF is an excellent airport as a second choice for Toronto people flying to Chicago Northeastern USA and Florida especially you are travelling with a whole family. Southwest fare from BUF to Florida is so low CAD150 include tax round trip for family of four flying from BUF to Florida can save you a lots of money! BUF itself is small user- friendly and just 1.5 hours from Toronto. I did that before - park my car check in security boarding all in 35 mins!
Have been using this airport as an alternative to Pearson Intl (YYZ- Toronto) because of Pearson’s outrageous airport fees. I have routinely bought an airline ticket thinking that it was a great price only to find out that the airport fees add another 80% to the ticket. Buffalo Intl is an ok airport its quite small but it gets the job done. One problem with this airport is the paltry number of flights that leave the airport. Unless you live in the Northeast it is almost impossible to fly without connecting somewhere. The only other gripe that I have is that the food selection at the airport is rather poor.
The most basic airport I have been to. Having been brought up in Burundi and been travelling there and back to the UK over several years I think this airport has gone downhill. Many years ago this was an exciting airport. People could see you off from the observation balcony but gone are the days! My dad wasn't even allowed into the airport to see me off. Airport staff will make your life hell just to say your last good byes to family. My Kenya Airways flight to Nairobi was slightly delayed coming into the airport due to a power cut! I have never experienced anything like it! My arrival into the airport was just as bad with airport staff wanting to open all bags and wanting bribes in order to keep things. Thank god my family had airport entry passes which meant we weren't left short changed. In all honesty I would still recommend as it's just a crazy yet brilliant experience!
This is a very basic and small airport. Facilities are limited. Most parts of the airport are covered but are not air conditioned relying on natural ventilation. Mosquitoes could be a problem at some times. Fortunately there are not too many staff hassling for your money. baggage reclaim was reasonably efficient. No real problems departing. Again there are very limited facilities. There are a couple of shops selling the usual tourist fare and expensive bottles of alcohol. The bar/café is not bad but is overpriced - $5 for a simple snack. The business lounge is nothing more than a room with a TV.
Note that this airport has not been officially called Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena airport for several years. It was renamed the Bob Hope Airport in 2003 (though most people just call it the Burbank Airport and the airport code is BUR). It is a small domestic airport with fewer airlines than in the past since American Airlines departed last year. Departing on our recent trip was a breeze: we stopped off our rental car at the Avis facility (Avis Hertz and one or two others are on the terminal site
Burbank provides a convenient and easy alternative to LAX although the departure hall in Terminal B is too small to accommodate more than 2 flights at a time. There were 4 flights (an MD-80 a 737 and 2 CRJ regional jets) boarding simultaneously and the small space and cramped conditions caused confusion and delayed boarding for everyone.
Bob Hope Airport as it is formally known is small and easy to navigate. Check-in counters have limited service with strong encouragement to use automated kiosks. No collection of hotels nearby as in the case of LAX but there are a few with shuttle service. As noted sparse food and shopping options. Not the best place to kill time if your flight is delayed. With some rental car companies you can quickly walk between the terminal and your car while with others you need to take a shuttle bus. You can also take one of the parking shuttles to the nearby Metrolink/Amtrak rail station.
Burbank is a very small regional airport serving the San Fernando Valley and northern Los Angeles suburbs with only 12 gates and no jetways but it's a very good alternative to the chaos that is LAX. There are flights on Southwest (dominant carrier) United US Airways JetBlue American and Alaska to all major western USA airports plus Dallas/Ft. Worth and New York JFK. The terminal is very small and can get overcrowded during peak times and food/beverage/concession options are very Spartan but it's easy to navigate has excellent free wi-fi and the security screening process is streamlined and well-run. You can also walk from the terminal to the long-term parking lot which you can't do at LAX.
BUR provides a pleasant alternative to LAX. The terminal complex is a bit small so during peak times it can get crowded but security and check-in lines move quickly. There are no jetways but being in California weather is seldom an issue and it's quite nice walking onto the tarmac to board your plane by stairs. If you're in a wheelchair they will use a mechanical lift to raise you to the aircraft door. The food and shopping offerings are bare bones and quite disappointing. If using the Metrolink rail is convenient to your travel BUR is an excellent alternative because there is a station across the street from the terminal but the airport is a bit difficult to get to by road because there is no freeway access within 2 miles. Traffic at rush hour can be difficult.
Small airport dating back to the early days of aviation when the thinking was that would be aerodromes in most towns. Today BUR is convenient airport for those wishing to avoid LAX. You pick up your bags from the baggage conveyor belt outside the terminal.
Enjoy flying in and out of BUR-very easy compact airport it is my preferred LA area airport. There about 10 times a year. If you rent from the correct car rental no need for buses you can walk right out to your car. The only bad aspect is time. Car rentals do not open for returns (if you want a receipt) until 6am and security does not open any earlier. Flew out yesterday and by the time I returned the car and got through security they were already boarding my flight-walked directly onto the plane. Not such a terrible thing I guess.
This airport is incongruous. On the one hand the food service stand such that it is is a cave. I am kind of worried that Sloth is hiding in the shadows. The music - effeminate EuroPop from the late 1980s - think Frankie Goes to Hollywood - just does not match the interior that may never have been renovated. Then you've got the external baggage claim. And Southwest. And JetBlue And a large mountain dominating the horizon. Once the DEA interrogated me on a tip during my business trip. And the exterior looks ripped out of 1973. It's all very bizarre.
"Burbank airport is a welcome relief from LAX. It's small and yes does not have the amenities of a large modern airport but those are its strong points. It's a ""human scale"" airport the type that is fast disappearing. The convenience of the train station and the freeways makes it a great place to fly from."
Just flew through BUR a couple of times. What a quaint little airport straight out of the 1930's. I'm sure it was fine for DC-3's but it struggles immensely with 737's. Christopher Schmidt mentions that terminal A is narrow. Well I flew out of terminal B and I thought that it was exceptionally narrow. Burbank is well located and fares are good but if you go there patience and a happy disposition will be great virtues. Also don't expect to get somewhere to sit while you're waiting.
Eat before you go to the airport. The food outlets offer items that were packaged during the Reagan administration! Terminal A (Southwest/America West) is extremely narrow! Terminal B (American/Alaska/Delta/United) is quite efficient
My trip through the Burbank Airport was a mixed experience. The passenger terminal has a run-down appearance to it that is in need of updating. Carpeting and wall paneling do not seem to have been upgraded in a while. The terminal lacks jet bridges and the baggage claim conveyor is out of doors which I actually find quite pleasant when the weather is nice but awful during rainstorms. The food and shopping options were minimal though I did not get a chance to check their prices. On the positive side however: the airport is very conveniently located for much of Los Angeles and has convenient access to the freeways. Despite the dilapidated look of the terminal it is a lot less confusing and intimidating than LAX - finding my way through the place was easy. The view of the mountains and desert outside of my airplane window on approach to the airport was enjoyable. The Southwest Airlines personnel did their jobs with the usual commendable levels of courtesy and professionalism and at no time did I find the lines to be too long.
It is the only airport regionally that people have to use. It is awful: understaffed clerks are rude flights often late or missed because of understaffing and can't make lines. It is customary to have people or entire groups of people get moved up in line in order for them to make their flights. Just plan on having things go wrong if flying through Burlington.
Small NW Tasmanian airport with flights to Melbourne & Tasmanian destinations. Neat & tidy with easy check-in & baggage collection. Small cafe/shop & enough seating for size of aircraft using airport. Not a bad little airport
This is my home airport. Completely renewed a few years ago it's now a very good and modern airport. Near the city center (just 5 minutes by car). It's a small airport but it's probably the better choice to come to Sardinia. Depending on winds you can have a fantastic view over the famous sardinian beaches from your airplane window. In the summer sometimes you may find crowds at security checks. There are just a few overpriced shops but this is common in italian airports. Car rentals taxis and bus are easy available.
"New nice and clean. This is the way I found this airport services are quite good even if restaurants bars and services in general could be improved. But this is a recent airport and the overall experience has been positive maybe in the future it will earn some more ""stars""."
Clean and efficient I was very impressed with Elmas airport. Staff are friendly and the airport is very well connected to the city centre by bus. The fare is only 0.67 €. Only one negative point once you're past the international departures hall there are no shops only one small cafe' near gate 23 otherwise this is one of the best regional airports I have visited so far.
Clean modern domestic terminal good choice of catering and adequate seating.
Arrived at domestic airport and straight out to taxis much improved on 2009 when last here. Flew out and quick security and check-in. However on the way back we were transferring from one domestic flight to another. You arrive and have to leave the terminal and walk around the outside to go back through security. Considering all the work that has taken place recently I was surprised the transfer situation is so inelegant.
We were flying CNS to HKG with Cathay Pacific and again very disappointed with Cairns Business Class Lounge. The food comprised of poor presentation along with an uninspiring menu. The only hot food displayed was soup and apart from various 'nibbles' the only other option was a dry baguette that had been sliced in inches and some salmon - completely unappetizing. As for drinks the chilled cabinet consisted of only four bottles of wine none of which were champagne as you would expect when you're paying Business Class prices. I had to find someone from the kitchen to ask if champagne was available and the young lady in charge told that no it wasn't available and that only a sparkling wine was an option. The bottle in the cabinet turned out to be flat and a fresh bottle was opened by said staff. Staff attitude was very poor. This wasn't our first time at Cairns Int. but the worst so far. And while we were in the Lounge a lady ground staff member in full high viz jacket came in and helped herself to some soup - unusual to say the least.
"Have just arrived here for the first time in three years. The so called ""renovation"" has finally been finished but is a total let down. Walkways to the gates are at least covered now and airconed but still concrete walkways with metal shed like walls around it worse than in 3rd world countries. Departure area has the same shops and fast food outlets as before. Major rip off is charging for luggage trolleys even in London Heathrow and LA they are free! Felt ashamed when I explained to dozens of tourists from the US and Japan that they need to pay (cash coins - not even credit cards accepted!) for these. Great welcome into the country and absolutely not excusable!"
I have travelled extensively around the world and would have to say that Cairns Domestic Airport is nothing short of disgraceful. Check in is OK but from there on it's an absolute shambles. Several flights have passengers in the one queue and you don't have any idea if you are in the correct one. The Airlines P/A is inaudible and there is very little seating in the common boarding area. Once you have worked out that you are in the correct very long queue it's a long wait to get through to the boarding check in and then it's almost a marathon walk to the aircraft. It must be at least 800+ metres and after walking up and down concrete ramps you then end up on an airbridge. There is no doubt that this appalling airport will put me off visiting Cairns again.
What a “dog’s breakfast” of a place is Cairns Domestic Airport. Arriving passengers parade through the departure terminal and eventually find their way into the baggage collection area. Dropping off passengers is also a trial. A very confusing series of direction signs can easily have motorists heading down dead ends or wrong roadways. It's the same for car rental returns. In the airport to get from the car rental desk to the check-in area requires a 100 metre walk in the scorching sun or pouring rain.
"Arrived at International terminal no facilities open at all - advised to go to domestic terminal put bags in locker and go through security to get some food ""International"". Airport is nice big and empty but that is about it."
Under staffed and lacking facilities such as airline lounges. Excessive queueing untidy restaurants and cramped waiting areas. A complete contradiction to the rest our Cairns experience.
I've transited Cairns airport domestically a number of times in the last 12 months. The building work does not appear to be progressing satisfactorily - the baggage collection area remains a disgrace and for those unlucky enough to be arriving at gate 18 or gate 1 there is a long very-poorly signposted walk landside having to clear security again. Colleagues tell me that the security queues aren't always that bad but I'm yet to experience short lines there.
Cairns Domestic is a shambles whilst the reconstruction of the terminal drags on forever. Make sure you have comfortable walking shoes on arrival as the trek from the domestic arrivals Gates 20-22 are via a poorly signposted circuitous route taking you to the other side of the terminal then you are directed outside in the elements dodging contractors and their equipment to a soulless baggage collection hall miles from anywhere. Totally inadequate seating for departures with passengers queuing up like sheep (despite everyone having an allocated seat) and blocking incoming passengers at the gate. PA announcements are inaudible and airport staff schlep around in a tropical topor.
Domestic terminal undergoing major renovations/additions. Long walk from gate through building site and then quite a way outside to taxi upon arrival. All ok if you are up to it but could be difficult for less mobile or with lots of baggage/children. Also ok if not pouring with rain. On departure taxi drops off and you have to cross a road without cover to get into terminal all ok if weather ok but you could get soaked if raining hard as is normal at this time of year. Was selected for hand baggage and clothing swab for explosives. Security staff nice and friendly.
Flew into Cairns as an international passenger from Darwin - very easy airport and the nicest welcome we have had on our trips to Oz. At 8 am there were adequate staff on passport and security control our baggage arrived quickly and checking was done nicely and efficiently with apologies for using us as a training example to a new member of staff. We got a taxi downtown the only hicup was that the sign telling you to phone from the taxi pickup point (if there are none there) was missing so we waited 15 mins before someone came over to tell us to phone.
Recently flew in and out of this airport on an international charter flight. I've been to Australia before and it is one of my favorite destinations in the world. However customs personnel upon arrival were unbelievably rude. You are not allowed to bring in food and I never carry food with me. However the sniffer dog indicated that I had food in my backpack. The customs official treated me like a criminal. After a thorough search of my backpack all he could find were cough drops. He turned on his heel and walked away with his dog and not another word. No apology of any kind. This is probably the rudest arrival I have ever experienced anywhere in the world and I travel quite a bit.
Used the Cairns domestic terminal recently. The arrivals area and baggage claim is a dump but the ticketing/check-in area and the departures area isn't bad. There's not much in the way of shopping or restaurants if you have time to kill and the seating areas are rather limited. The Qantas lounge is pretty decent and best of all it's a very short walk (just a couple of hundred feet) from the baggage claim to the taxi stand and about the same from the passenger drop-off area to the terminal entrance on arrival - though this makes the A$4 baggage cart rental fee a big rip-off. Taxis are also reasonably priced to the city despite the long distance.
Flew in and out of Cairns International recently and found the airport a breeze. Only a handful of carriers use the international terminal. Airside has all the usual stores duty free and a centre cafe. They even have a chocolate store. Great lounges and plenty of space with none of the crowds of other gateways airports to Australia. Would recommend to anyone arriving or leaving Australia.
Cairns airport is a little run down but still functional. Only problem is the lack of a decent coffee and meal at the domestic airport! Hungry Jacks is always a crowd pleaser but when you need a good coffee at 5:00am its just not possible!
I've only used the domestic portion (I fly via SYD) and while it is small and a bit run-down it's not a bad airport. In addition to the too-tiny baggage carousel the Virgin Blue check-in area needs to be rearranged a bit. The queue for computerized check-in became entangled in the queue for the baggage drop. The computerized check-in area needs to be moved further away. I also appreciated the centralized booking desk for the shuttles to town. On my last trip there I liked the convenience of on-site car rental and return but as with any Australian airport you pay an extra tax on the car that you wouldn't if you rented the car in town.
The facilities at Cairns airport aren't all that bad
I was fairly impressed by the range of retail stores available for international transit passengers at Cairns airport - mainly tropical touristy items but that reflects the city. Not a great range of eating places a hamburger bar sushi and Japanese snacks and a cafe with cakes and slices for sale. All shops and restaurants were open when we arrived at 6:30am. The airport incuding the bathrooms appeared pretty clean. Decent views of the runway from the transit area. All in all a fairly pleasant place to stop for a short time.
Arrived at CNS airport on a Qantas flight from Brisbane and departed on an Australian Airlines flight to Singapore 4 hours later. The domestic and international terminals are linked by a covered and paved walkway and was a short and comfortable walk despite the heat (middle of the day on 26 December). Our luggage was tagged to SIN when we departed BNE so we didn't have to worry about lugging bags between terminals. CNS is not a big airport and doesn't have loads of retail outlets or much choice for food but the staff are friendly the terminal is modern and fresh the beer at the bar is cold and we spent the four hours comfortably. We went on to deal with the masses in SIN LHR AMS BKK and SYD airports and concluded that the smaller and more relaxed airport at CNS was the better of our experiences.
While International Airport is very small and easy to walk from one end to the other the gate number signage as you go into the departures lounge is poor. Also there are not enough screens screens showing boarding and departure times and the relevant gate numbers.
A nice and comfortable little airport but were relatively frustrated by the staff. Myself and partner flew in to spend a 10 days in Port Douglas/Cairns area and could not remember the exact address of hotel - Air NZ hostess recommended we just write hotel name. Big mistake. Were questioned by police as well as customs officials bags scanned extra 3 times searched and looted through. Apparently they thought we were going to overstay in the country but the customs staff were extremely rude and definately ruined the start of the holiday. Both Air NZ and Qantas ground staff were very helpful though which improved the experience slightly!
Departed from Cairns to London Heathrow via Tokyo for a family holiday. We were very impressed by the facilities offered at the airport especially in the departures lounge. Our only criticism would be that the departures lounge for international flights is locked until about 90mins before departure which meant that we had to hang around for 3 hours with little to do after arriving at the international terminal after a domestic flight. Otherwise a very welcoming airport which is bright and well designed.
An airport that serves only 6 International Air carriers (I think) - it is breezily functional. Cool and modern the Australian airports tend to resemble each other - with little character to differentiate from each other. The Cairns Airport does look a little too big for its purpose. Check- in was fast and efficient though as there was minimal queue if any at all. Everything was done with little fuss and was much appreciated. Airport is only about 15-20 minutes away from the City Centre/Esplanade via Airport Shuttle Bus.
I recently used the Cairns International Airport as my gateway into/out of Australia. It is a small airport with big value. There are only two terminals at the Cairns airport both of which can be comfortably walked end-to-end in 2 minutes. But there are no large crowds long line-ups. Customs clearance was fast and efficient (4 inspections questionings). There is a covered walkway between terminals which could be oppressively hot on a summer day but was quite enjoyable at 1 AM after flying for 20 hours. The domestic terminal is very quite at that time of night. They provide cushioned benches which could be cleaner but were welcome for a 5 hr layover.
"Cairo Airport Terminal 1 is one of the worst travel experiences I have encountered. Everything about the terminal is unpleasant; from arriving at the terminal to boarding your flight or indeed arriving at the terminal and leaving the terminal is beyond comprehension. What makes it more astounding is carriers such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways operate into the terminal. Bring on the new terminal, but when will it be completed?"
The airport is very badly sign posted and I found myself getting lost more than once something that has never happened to me in an airport before and I am a frequent traveler. You are often pestered by staff for a tip for even the most basic service. The selection of souvenirs was poor surprising given this is Egypt. The security arrangements seem illogical as you are screened by security twice just yards apart before check in. There is also a serious shortage of seating which is an issue if you are traveling with old or infirm people. Make sure you pre-arrange a pick up when arriving as fake cab drivers swarm around you on arrival if you appear to be looking lost.
Very poor Shuttle Service between terminals. We had to change buses between 2 Terminals. No instructions given the bus just stopped and driver got off. Passengers we looked at each other what should we do now? OK we changed buses on to the desired terminal then we are dropped off across the entrance in a parking lot not in front of the terminal entrance. So off we go pulling our suitcases. What ever happened to the people mover? No clear signs for Shuttle nor for the train between terminals.
"Visited Cairo for a conference at a glance during arrival the airport seemed ok clean not at all crowded Immigration was a breeze with only 1 counter operating out of about 30 counters toilets were clean and I was out of the airport in about 30 min. The real problem started when I was departing. Be prepared to get tired of hearing the word ""baaksheesh"" which means a tip. Every person you see shall approach you for a tip even if it is their duty. The airport doesn't offer free drinking water facilities you have to buy it. Announcements were excellent and they went the extra mile to announce in the language of the destination for International Flights."
On 28/11/2014 I arrived to Cairo Airport on an MEA flight bounded from Beirut. The whole situation is in chaos. The smell in the airport is terrible. Immigration officers as well as customs officers are extremely rude and stubborn.
"Pleasant modern airport not too big and not too small. Journey to and from Cairo is always fraught a shrug is the common response to asking how long you should allow but let's hope the Metro promised for next year materialises on time. But why can't the toilets have soap? And be less smelly? Why can't the ""FreeAirportWifi"" work? Why do the scamming porters who clamour to push your luggage 30 meters whether you protest or not and then ask for money apparently do so with the airport's blessing and wearing an official looking uniform? These are all national stereotypes but better airport management would roll them back a bit and encourage tourists back to Egypt."
"Flew from KL arrived with Emirates at CAI Terminal 1. This terminal is awful. Upon arrival people rushed to the immigration where only 5 counters were open both for Egyptians and foreigners resulting in long queue. Immigration officer was just rude threw my passport after stamping it. Waited for about half an hour for my luggage. Toilet beside the carousel dirty and disgusting. Before exiting the airport custom officer requested to see my passport and scan my luggage. After scanning them they asked for ""tips"" and won't let me pass through after I pay them some money. That's not it after exiting the terminal annoying taxi drivers started to surround and trying to take away my trolley. Thank god I had someone waiting for me. When we reached to our car two men out of nowhere came and grabbed our luggage and put them into the boot and then asked for tips. This whole arriving experience was nightmare. Overall it was a bad arriving experience after you have flown for 10+ hour flight."
Terminal 1 is a bit chaotic but small and friendly enough to get through without too much trouble. With an early departure our hotel had prepared a breakfast selection bags for us all which along with our tots we had no difficulty with at any of the myriad security checks. Well done Cairo T1.
"On most of my trips here in Egypt I have encountered extremely nice Egyptians. Today I arrived at the airport to leave and a guy came up to me as I am walking through the security check at the front asking me if I was flying with Lufthansa. He was wearing an employee tag over his neck so I thought he is an airport employee being helpful. I said yes and he grabbed my luggage set it down next to him and asked me for money. At this time another man came by also wearing tags and the younger one says ""give him money"". I gave the older man 20 Egyptian dollars. He proceeds to say ""give him (younger guy) money too"". At which point I said I don't have anymore money. He kept pressuring me saying US dollars will be okay too and I kept saying I don't have any. He pestered me all the way to the check in counter while holding on to my luggage almost hostage. After I told him many times that I don't have any more money he dropped my luggage on the floor and left. If Egypt wants to revive their tourism they really need to do something about this situation because now I am much less inclined to come back the next time I have vacation. What a terrible experience! Other than that the airport is new although not too fancy. Quite a selection of shops you can go to and food."
"Flew in and out from Doha. Terminal 1 is pleasant even though there are no jet bridges. The check in used to be mainly in the main hall (which is still there) but they decided to open 10 more at the back side and its quite a tight fit and very uncomfortable when it fills up with passengers. You definitely need to jump over many to get to passport control. Cairo is knows with every single staff trying to get some tips. Standing by the gate that clearly says ""Doha"" they ask me whether I am flying to Doha and as I reply yes they extend their palm and wish me a pleasant flight ""and wait for a tip"". I'm half Egyptian so I am used to it but can get real annoying after a while. Passport control is fast. Avoid Duty free that has nothing special. cafeteria exorbitant and overpriced. Word of advice. The gates are very very small so in case your flight is full and a wide body aircraft try and be one of the last to get to gate as its filled to the brim and very uncomfortable. When boarding starts everyone is everywhere."
I was amazed to find the airport very clean and comfortable. At first I was very worried about what I would find as I had a 6 hrs layover in between flights. Most comments I had read online were very negative. However upon arrival I was pleased to find a fairly new and modern airport facility. All employees were very accommodating bathrooms were clean and food venues were great! The only negative aspect of my experience was the lack of proper internet. Although there is free WiFi it is so slow that it does not work.
The old terminal is nice but it needs more improvements in facilities and entertainment. It also has a nice apron view. The new terminal is excellent but more facilities are needed. All lounges are 3 stars they don't have showers and alcohol.
Simply the most chaotic airport well not as chaotic as Jeddah airport however as a reputable country like Egypt should have a better terminal than this joke small claustrophobic building since the 1960s the most annoying issue was the people harassing you for taxis and limousines and for luggage assistance why it is not organized like everywhere else. 3 passport control desks during a busy period of the day with so many flights going everywhere queue felt like forever duty free is ridiculously expensive more expensive than market prices and than any other place in the world. Basic facilities in terms of cafes and restaurants dirty bathrooms couldn't even use it. How this is an airport in a country with tourists from everywhere. Have to use it every few months as family lives there.
Arrived from JNB early morning. Very expensive and poorly laid out. Unsmiling staff and very long queues to transfer. Toilets were filthy with no toilet paper or soap and no attendants around to ask for help.
Flew BKK-CAI-BKK and for arrival as well as for departure all went perfect with some minute issues. On arrival all went without a hitch from arrival (bussed to terminal) passport control and bags were delivered fast. The T3 is used by Egyptair and Star Alliance. Modern and airy. Official taxis at 6 am refused the official taximeter price but there was no other option. Departure was all right but the crowds at the first X-ray and checking the tickets as only passengers are allowed to the Check In counters. So many people and bit of chaos. Watch your bags as they seem to send them through the scanner and you end up stuck by the metal detector for your turn. Once you cross that everything else is s breeze. Check in took seconds passport control fast. Air side several interesting shops but I have to say they are truly expensive. So shame on you Cairo airport charging for a small 500ml bottle of normal water 25EGP when it costs roughly 1.5EGP. Second X-ray and documents check when entering the gate itself. The gates are well placed but there is no place to sit if the gate is still closed.
I was in Terminal 3 for a morning flight to Istanbul. I was very impressed with the airport cleanliness and facilities. The duty free shops had plenty of good and moderately priced merchandise. Moreover there were several food outlets all with good quality and satisfying different tastes. This airport is also good for transiting passengers.
"For an airport which is less than 5 years old and which was (presumably) purpose-built for its home carrier Egyptair CAI is a horrific experience. The terminal is built in a V-shape  with F and G gates extending along the arms of the 'V'. H gates are for flights accessible by bus and the gates are downstairs at the base of the V. There is no real holding area where passengers can wait for their flights except two largeish restaurants. As a result the arms of the terminal (i.e. the F and G gates) are severely crammed with passengers awaiting flights. The layout of each arm means that access between the restaurants and the F/G gates re often blocked by passengers queuing for flights and every available seat was taken. I visit the airport twice in September. On the first occasion I was changing from Egyptair to Ethiopian (both international flights) and had to hand in my passport for it to be checked by immigration. Surely this contravenes the laws of international transit? I then had to go back downstairs to international arrivals to pick up my passport and get a re-issued boarding card one hour before departure of my ET flight. On the second trip I was changing between MS flights so I thought ""great no problem"". However my onward boarding card was handwritten and was forced to join the long international transit passenger queue by some unpleasant jobsworth. There were around 10 people behind the counter but only one was actually doing any work. It was only when a second official asked if anybody had an onward boarding card that I managed to queue-jump and get a re-issued printed boarding card quickly. Internet access is available outside one of the several lounges for Star Alliance Business/First class passengers. Finally there is a smoking room opposite gate F2 but this was simply disgusting: dirty too small and with just three chairs. If an airport is going to offer smoking facilities to its guests it should either do it properly or not at all."
Perhaps some travelers are satisfied by a new airport building. I am happy if I must not stay at any airport for longer than necessary. Cairo is a very bad example for ignoring customers. My flight from Nairobi with Egyptair was delayed almost 90 minutes! There was no explanation and wrong information from airline staff. It would have been no problem to get the connection flights. But Cairo seems to want to avoid delays in their statistics. So they sent the connection flights.
Flew to and from Cairo Intl T1 the old renovated terminal for all international airlines T3 is for Egyptair and star alliance which I try to avoid as much as possible since it is big and crowded T1 is small and sometimes can get congested as well but in my view still better. Arrived and bussed to terminal since there are no air bridges here arrival hall is a very small claustrophobic room not the cleanest however surprisingly didn't queue much for passport control. Waiting for luggage felt like forever taxi drivers trying to grab you and your luggage is still an annoying issue departure was a better experience. I prefer the coziness of T1 still in good shape and has a decent food and beverage outlets and small nice duty free though very annoying with the non stop flight announcements for departure and arrival I wonder why it was only in Arabic. Still better than the chaotic T3 and lets wait and see the outcome of the major renovation of T2.
A new terminal has been added to the old one - that means that when you arrive and remote parked there is a quite long drive to the terminal. As everything in Egypt arrival can be quite stressful you need to buy your entrance ticket (visa) by the exchange offices you might as well change money at the same time. Then you go through passport/visa control and then luggage area. you might be asked again for a passport check before leaving the airport. Coming out of terminal please hold on to everything you have as strangers will grab your luggage without asking and expect a tip. Even if you have an ordered transfer they let the strangers take it - everybody makes the most out of emptying the tourists pockets. In case you are arriving at international and need a connecting domestic flight it can be a bit tricky but follow the signs and ask your way to a small corridor - which by the way is a very popular praying area. When you arrive at the airport terminal touts will round you up and ask if you are flying Egyptair (it is the Egyptair terminal so of course you are) they pretend they are VIP handlers and take your luggage to first security screening demanding money before you enter. Check in is slow. Until you reach your plane you will be subjected to 4-6 security checks and many of them ask you to pay tips - even cleaning staff will follow you into the toilets handing you toilet paper and ask for money. There are shops and eateries which are overpriced. Use all Egyptian pounds before entering the terminal- they do not change it back. When boarding first you go through security screening then one person checks your boarding card and passport then you walk 1 meter and a new security person checks your boarding card and passport - and before you enter the airplane another security person checks your boarding card.
Flew in and out from Cairo airport with KLM (Business Class). Skyteam flies to terminal 1 (the face lifted old terminal with no sky bridges). Its a nice terminal since T2 is in complete renovation and I suspect they will return there and T3 is only Egyptair and Star Alliance. Arrival was on time but many passengers as there were 2 planes from Saudi Arabia. Bags already waiting and out in no time. Taxis hunting for arrivals so a good idea to avoid them and take an official taxi to avoid rip off. NO Sky Priority for any Business class passengers. Departure was a breeze at check in. No priority fro C class passengers at passport control. Couple of nice shops and cafes. The C class lounge is quiet and nice with non-functional internet which managed to irk most guests. The holding boarding gate is too small to hold a full B777 so it caused great discomfort to passengers and the numerable carts and wheelchairs. Very claustrophobic. Bussing to and the terminal is OK. T3 is far better to handle crowds and is up to par with other international airports. T1 is functional but needs a little help.
I flew into and out of terminal 3. Check-in was ok with a little wait and some confusion over which was the right desk to check into. My main issue was with the price of the food drinks and duty free. I know airport prices are usually high but this was ridiculous. A bottle of water which costs 1.50 EGP in the street cost 10 EGP - a very high markup indeed. Main message - eat before and bring drinks/snacks for the terminal/plane. On arrival we had to jump on a bus to get to the terminal itself from the plane but after that the passport area was easy to pass through (we already had a visa) baggage collection no worries and then customs didn't even bother to check our bags. As others have said the most annoying part of arrival is the tour guides/taxi drivers you run into after leaving the arrivals area. Yes the airport should at least keep them out of the terminal and have a proper system to deal with taxis. Try to pre-arrange transport if you can and if you can't ask the place you are staying for a fair estimate of a taxi fare and only get in a taxi that agrees to your fare. If you are after an experience and not sweat the small stuff you will be rewarded greatly.
I think I was surprised to experience such a modern airport in Africa I fly frequently to different cities in Africa and I mostly face terrible and hard times with every flight. Last week I flew Egyptair to a transit in Cairo with a connection to Lagos. The airport is clean nice well organized and easy to move in.
Cairo T3. Arrival from Sharm for connection to Heathrow. Incoming aircraft parked at a remote stand and we were bussed via what seemed a circuitous route to the terminal. Followed directions for flight transfer to reach emigration
Going through the much-touted terminal three there was nothing open for a morning departure - save for Duty Free and a handful of snack bars. Surprisingly I encountered no shakedown attempts from employees but then again the airport is understaffed. Arrival in terminal 1 was uneventful but still confusing. It's not as if you'll have many other options if you're flying to Egypt and are on a tight schedule.
Truly one of the most awful airport experiences I have encountered. From the minute you land you are hassled by 'officials' offering taxis trips to pyramids. Trying to get free shuttle bus from terminal 3 to terminal 1 you will be told there isn't one a taxi will offer to take you the 2km journey for $10 which should only be $2. Airport staff grab your bags and take to x-ray machines and then expect a gift. As somebody who lives in Egypt I try to avoid this airport and would rather fly out of Sharm to England.
I passed through Terminal 3 when flying from Istanbul to Luxor and was pleasantly surprised. On arrival the visa windows were well signposted and immigration quite efficient. I made my way to the Domestic floor without being hassled by anyone indeed there only seemed to be about a dozen people in the whole Terminal. Quiet clean plenty of places to sit or get coffee water and something to eat. On return from Luxor I just followed the signs for connecting flights and went quickly through security only to find my Egyptair flight to Istanbul was delayed by 55 minutes. But there were shops to look at and decent looking food outlets too.
Cairo airport must be the most awkward airport in the world. I have flown through all 3 terminals so I know it quite well. There is no point in referring to the appalling terminal 2 as it is no longer in operation. The quality of staff and security processes are the biggest issues in my opinion. Regarding the staff there seems to be a scam between airport officials and taxi drivers to hand you over to the drivers that will rip you off. If you can prearrange transport you will be able to avoid that. There are 2 members of staff at passport control. The first will look at your passport and put the visa sticker on it and the second one will stamp it. And they both sit side by side. You have to security scan your suitcases before you check-in which causes absolute chaos. The stories are endless about this airport. On the up it is a clean airport modern and spacious with good duty free and good dinning options. And I have to say I have seen some improvements over the last 2 years which shows that Egyptians are making an effort to improve it.
Upon arrival before passport control touts approach you trying to get money for helping you through immigration or for organizing taxis. Completely unnecessary help! Departure hall chaotic and people smoking everywhere. Filthy toilets. Hard to understand how a country with tourism being so important and with special tourist police doesn't do anything about the airport.
"Arrived at 2am from Amsterdam. Immigration was quick and easy. Bags arrived quickly. Went to airport shuttle without any issues. However the departure from Terminal 1 was horrible. From the moment I was dropped off I was hounded with offers to ""help"". Additionally the airport employees are definitely part of the scheme to mis-guide you leading you to a position where you feel like you have to pay someone to get you to the correct place. The trip to Cairo was great but the lack of organization and the constant attempts to take money from you really soured the departure."
"Arrived late at night on Air France and were towed to a remote gate. Bussed for ages to Terminal 3 for customs. The agent was cold and rude not pleasant after a long 2 days of flying. He only gave some of our group arrival stamps which was strange. The terminal itself was beautiful and very western except for broken toilets in the bathrooms. The next morning the 5am Egyptair to Aswan. The terminal requires security to reach check in then once again at the gate. I don't think they even looked at the first screening. The airport was clean and very modern. Boarding through the gate was strange as a man opened the door and simply said ""time to board"" not through a PA system or anything. Departing on Air france a week later through terminal 1 was crazy. People can pay security a few dollars to jump ahead cutting our group of kids into chunks. Check in was painfully slow but that is the airline's fault. Customs heading out was fast and the man gave me a strange look for not having an arrivals stamp. At the gate one metal detector was there to screen our airbus 330! Again 5 pounds and passengers were escorted to the front of the line. We were then bussed out to our plane back to the civilized world."
Cairo terminal 3 is spacious with great Star Alliances lounges and efficient check in/immigration facilities. It took less than 30 minutes from touch down to be on a cab to town.
Flying Dar-es-salaam to London last week I had to transit for 5 hours in Cairo. They gave all transit passengers to London a free city tour of Cairo for 3 hours! Lunch was also included which was a take away lunch box from a local restaurant. They even sorted out all the visa formalities for all of us.
"My return flight from Cairo has left a bit of a sour taste. I think that ""tea money"" or bakshish was requested virtually on each step from check in till boarding which is something I haven't experienced yet in CAI airport before. It started when I flew from Munich to Cairo T3 where I had a 2 days stop over. Passport control was fast which is great after that and 2 meters from passport control a police officer re-checks your passport to see the entry stamp. You go to puck up your bags and there it starts. When you see your bag and go to get it then you find a couple of guys trying to help you forcefully and then expect tea money as they specifically said it. I go through the ""green zone"" which practically isn't that green as everyone is being controlled. Check passport again and open bags. close bags and ""welcome to Cairo any chance for tea money sir?"". The arrival hall is empty as all waiting people were kicked out for some reason or another. My departure for Bangkok was definitely an experience. I will count passport checks and tea money from my check in to boarding! TO enter the hall and the check in area then you have to be only a passenger - so I got my passport checked and the gentleman wished me a pleasant flight and some tea money. I go to Xrays to enter the check in area so I get my passport checked and the officer smiled and asked if I had any tea money. I go to check in that took longer than its supposed to. Each check in counter has a gentleman to help the bags on the scales. Since I had only a small bag I helped myself and my passport checked and tea money was asked by the helper. I proceed to Passport control and go through with ease. I proceed to the gate where the passport is checked and went again through x rays while boarding at the door the passports were checked again and I was once again asked for tea money. I was annoyed by that stage - going through he airbridge to the plane and what do we have there - a gentleman controlling my passport I mean security is a good thing but this is a bit weird. I would like to rest assured tourists will be spared much of the tea money (not a guarantee) since I am part Egyptian and look so. So the terminal can be as clean and modern as can be but his has topped any experience that I had."
"What a difference a Terminal makes. Terminal 2 still is a joke and an embarrassment. Terminal 3 is the first time I felt like flying to Cairo and actually landing in an airport that is closer to standards. The new terminal is however used only by Egyptair and Star alliance. The terminal building is airy and clean sufficient amount of shops and cafes walking distances are not that far. The access taxiways to the terminal takes ages so the planes taxing was around 25min! The negative points are more because of local habits. For the first time I met a female passport control officer who was rude for that I am taking 2 stars off. Only passengers can enter the terminal building even the waiting areas. If you are not a passenger then you have to ""buy"" a ticket which is a bit annoying as they sent us 600m away to a stall to get the ticket. I realize that this is to control the crowds and the ""taxi drivers"" who hunt for arrivals but this is not the way to do it. Only passengers are allowed al the way to check in counters! Check in agents helpful and a young crowd. So I guess its a far better place than I have experienced in an Egyptian airport."
Chaos seems to be the order of the day at this airport for arrivals and departures. Give yourself lots of time for check-in. Road access is very circuitous could not find indicators/screens to advise of arrivals and departures in Terminal 1 arrivals hall transfers from one terminal to another was convoluted. Be aware of Islamic holidays and other special times when the crowds are checking in.
"Went through terminal 2 on flight to/from Doha on Qatar Airways. On arrival I was hustled by various people who wanted to ""help"" me find a taxi etc. even before immigration. This terminal is a mess! The building is old and run down. On the way home food was poor and overpriced and staff are either not interested or looking for some kind of tip. Really it's not a pleasant place to spend two hours and does not give a good first impression on arrival. On the other hand I flew domestic on EgyptAir through new terminal 3 building during my visit to Egypt which was a much better experience although signage and announcements were lacking. Keep an eye on the boards as they can change without warning!"
Arrived from JFK to CAI new terminal. Facilities were neat immigration fast customs a bit confusing . Long wait for luggage but finally arrived. Terminal building was nice modern  signage sufficient staff a bit disorganized but finally everything fell in it's place.
I have flown a number of flights through the new T3. Better traffic control outside newer/modern look alcohol available in bar/restaurant many gates with walkways fairly efficient check in and passport control departing. The bad - business class lounge (they just opened a second Egyptair this last week) are poor - the attendant told me they would be opening up a nicer one in a matter of months frequently claim a gate is open when it isn't so you walk all the way and are stuck in a hall with a bunch of other people in front of the closed gate (and you have to go through security again) and on arrival the scene at passport control is pure chaos! I spent 30+ minutes in the business/first class line because they allowed individuals with group passports (5-10 passports in a stack) to cut ahead of the business and first class passengers in line! The other lines were extremely long and extremely slow. And also bad is you still get stuck using a bus despite them having open gates and the drive from plane to terminal is a good fifteen minutes. So overall I'm pretty disappointed and actually preferred terminal one with its McDonalds Starbucks and Cinnebon (none of which have a franchise in T3).
I am using Cairo airport on a regular basis (T1 and T2) and it is not really an enjoyable place to get through. CAI is just disorganised people jump queues crowd control at departure is inexistant signage is inconsistent and the chaos at passport control (Terminal 1) is something worth being filmed although immigration officers do an obvious effort to be polite on arrival. Options for transport to the city vary between shabby taxis and being ripped off by so called limousine agencies. No trains or decent buses are available. Terminal 3 has recently opened and let's hope that is gives a better image of the country.
Complete nightmare avoid this airport at all costs. Badly laid out and staff are rude and unhelpful. Overpriced food dirty bathrooms generally unpleasant. Smokers everywhere. Unfortunately had to spend a total of 11 hours there - never again. Pyramids are not worth this.
"Absolutely horrible! Upon arrival before passport control aggressive touts approach you form all sides trying to get money for helping you trough immigration or for organising taxis. Completely unnecessary ""help""! Departure hall chaotic and people smoking every where. Filthy toilets stinking from far away! Hard to understand how a country with tourism being so important and with special tourist police doesn't do anything about the airport!"
Arrival in Terminal 1 was disappointing building seemed old and was rather crowded. No organised lines whatsoever and complete chaos. However departure from same terminal (Terminal 1) was a different story. Departure seems very new large LCD screens displaying flight information organized check-in desksmany immigration kiosks. There were many food outlets such as McDonald's Starbucks Cinnabon etc. The airport-facing side of the waiting area is all glass which enables you to watch all the planes. Hopefully issues concerning departure will be solved with the opening of Terminal 3 this month.
Arrived in original older terminal. Old dilapidated and poorly signed. I'm not sure where I was supposed to obtain a visa (I had one already in my passport from consulate at home). Baggage gathering was straightforward but a little chaotic. It took me a good half hour to get my luggage. Departure terminal was fine. Beware of crooked people who pretend to be airport staff but are just looking for tips. Otherwise modern airport after you go through security. McDonald's Star Bucks and a few other shops. Smoking is permitted in certain areas and one room.
"The arrival in the new airport went very smoothly but the international departure hall is a total mess. There is a separate Star Alliance/Egyptair business section giving the privilege to have longer queues than in the economy main hall. Signs are confusing plenty of people around trying to ""guide"" you for faster processing against a tip in all a miserable place."
"I arrived and departed to Madrid on IB and also domestic on EgyptAir. Signs and announcements are confusing was given wrong departure gate and staff are unresponsive and unhelpful. Terminal sheathed in decaying white ceramic makes it seem like an old WC. It took 2 hours to get past security and immigration long queues and total chaos and no food except one cafe with sweets and bread both not recommended. Very hungry. Domestic Arrivals much worse. No working signs at all in baggage reclaim only 2 working belts for all flights so luggage split across more than one belt extremely over crowded and no information. Wasted 90 mins locating luggage. Touts all around arrivals to ""help"" with luggage taxis whatever. No control or rules at all. Very aggressive hassle in taxi area. New terminal should now be open may be better structurally but I doubt will help resolve biggest problem of general disorder and confusion is worker issue not infrastructure. New metro line will avoid taxi touts though. Not recommended for transfer passengers but if flying onward in Egypt or to/from Cairo no real choice."
One of the worst transit-airports ever. Flew business class from Amman to Cairo (with Royal Jordanian) and on to Nairobi (with Kenya Airways). Upon arrival a bus took me to one terminal where I had to wait ten minutes before boarding another bus to another terminal where I had to hand in my passport and had to wait 25 minutes (no explanation given) before my passport was returned to me. I then boarded a third bus which took me back to the other terminal. There the whole thing started again. Handed in my passport and e-ticket to immigration and had to wait for over half an hour (people smoking all around me) before I got my passport back this time with boarding pass. All with all a very time consuming procedure. The business class lounge is very small and asking for a drink feels like asking a big favour. Staff very unfriendly. All with all this airport is not to be advised for anyone flying in/out with two different airlines.
Probably the worst international airport - absolute mess in all aspects. Huge queues for immigration on arrival and chaotic baggage collection with no clear boards mentioning the flight name. Airport full of touts to assist in passport control taxis hotels etc and no one seems to be bothered to control or regulate them. Departure was worse and resembled a cattle market to put it mildly. Huge queues everywhere from baggage screening to check in to passport control. No clear announcements and all boards are totally worn out. Total disregard for smoking rules thru out the terminal. No places to sit before check in. Toilets are very dirty and unmaintained. Duty free is a joke with items priced several times the price outside and first class lounge ridiculous. Hardly any food on offer and in noon all I could see was stale bread and pastries from morning. An absolute shame for a country which houses so many tourist marvels and attracts millions every year. Probably thats the reason no one is bothered at any cost people have to use this airport to come to Egypt. If there is any ranking less than zero I would give that!
Cairo Terminal 1. BA requested our presence three hours before the 8:35 AM departure and I duly showed up. The security people however did not start screening until 2.5 hours before so a long single form line for all classes was the result. In fact apart from the check-in counter nowhere in the entire process of boarding are there dedicated First Business or Elite Customer lines. The BA check in staff were unaware of the arrival terminal change in Heathrow (not T5 thank goodness but T4). I found out as I was trying to understand where my connecting Heathrow Delta flight to Atlanta was departing from (turned out to be T4 as well). The Cairo International terminal BA uses is old.A new terminal is in the process of being built which surely will bring a better quality pre-flight experience. As it is BA offers the use of a generic lounge which is small with very old and not entirely clean looking furniture and a TV tuned to Al Jazeera. There are two old nondescript standard and not entirely clean fridges carrying somewhat cold water and soft drinks. There was nobody manning the bar and there was no food apart from nuts despite this being an early AM departure. There was free wireless internet. I went out to find some breakfast and ended up in a coffee shop which served fresh croissants. The terminal offers some shopping but many were closed at this early hour. The lighting in the terminal is harsh and the use of tiles everywhere creates a sterile and impersonal cold atmosphere. Boarding was the worst chaos of all. All passengers were hoarded into a pre-boarding area. The two BA representatives scanned all boarding passes but did not offer any assistance to people in wheel chairs (there were about 5 on this flight) or people with small children. A lone police man started checking passports when the door for boarding opened and it was each man woman and disabled person for themselves… A shambles. All in all the fact that a new terminal is being built is absolutely necessary. But for the time being you might be better off traveling on one of the Sky Team airlines as they depart from the already opened new Terminal 2.
Calcutta Airport has come up to speed in the recent years and it's about time too! I only used to fly into CCU because it was the closest International Airport to Orissa and cut my journey time by a day. However it was always a tiring and bothersome task fighting my way through the immigration and baggage handling policies they seemed to practice - slow slower and at one stage stop! Flying in wasn't too bad - on a good day I could be off the plane and in a taxi within the hour (depending on the carrier). However departing from CCU was a chore - Immigration then check your baggage tags to bags then Passport Control then a small tussle with Security and Baggage Check then finally the (what seemed like a mile) hike to the plane! However those days are gone if you fly in with BA - they insisted on a proper Gate being constructed and it is now up and running! Much to my delight it's just a hop and a skip to the plane and then you're on your way. Yes you still have to grapple with Security and Passport Control but the last three times I have flown into/out of CCU I have been spared the ordeal of searching for my bags and tallying them up with my ticket tags.
I can't believe that it took me 45 minutes to get through one domestic security line-up! Good thing I gave myself 3 hours allowance to fly domestic. I have never seen such a slow security check. There were 5 lines but only two were operational and one of them was for Nexus. However there were at least 6 personnel being trained on the functioning machines and so many other personnel hovering around. When my husband asked why it's taking so long the staff said no it's not taking long and one personnel said that everyone came together all of a sudden. I don't think this airport is equipped to handle massive amounts of passengers. Then my husband's backpack was searched for the hand scale that he had in his bag. Meanwhile I had the same hand scale in my backpack and my bag was not searched. Such inconsistencies and inefficiencies. I travel around the world frequently and I have not seen such slow-paced and inconsistent security check point.
"This Airport is an airport that supports your needs. Food was great and staff were helpful. The signage was helpful in guiding us to the correct area for check-in and I don't have to keep asking every single staff member I meet to ask ""Where is ..."" Departure: Once past check-in you can enjoy views of the aircraft or eat or if you are late go to security. Once there you go past like a breeze (Full Queen = 10-15 Min. wait time). After that there are shops offering travel comforts (e.g. Headphones Neck rests pillows toothbrushes etc.) and coffee shops are there. US pre-clearance is also good and takes ~5 min. per person (if you are a normal traveler). The US pre-clearance features shops. Arrivals: After you arrive head up the stairs wait ~20 min. on average and you are out of there."
While the US-Transborder areas are atrocious for food options and lounges the airport as a whole is not bad. Checking in is easy (usually) and is made easier if you are elite security has long queues through the transborder checkpoint but this is resolved by using the NEXUS lane (if you have one) (it is a great investment) and that brings me to Customs and Immigration. The CBSA hall is quite a trek from your arrival gate but it isn't as bad as LHR T2. Once at the checkpoint the officers are polite and if you have NEXUS you can be out of customs in 2 mins. Going through US CBP on the way to the US takes a bit longer though agents are generally polite and expedient. Back to NEXUS (there's a theme forming here). If you apply and get accepted you also get Global Entry benefits for US CBP so if you have it US CBP is also 2 mins. Sorry for skipping around here but the gate area for domestic flights (Concourses A and D) is big enough to find something to eat and somewhere to eat it and also has Lounges if you are so inclined. Transborder
Have been through Calgary airport several times in transit from UK. It has never been good but last October very poor. I could not believe the surly robotic attitude of the security staff. If this is the welcoming face of Canada to visitors I wouldn't plan on increased tourism. This time as I write having just missed my connecting flight by minutes because the ground crew spent over 20 minutes connecting the bridge to deplane from my UK flight. Again miserable faced security and after 17hours travelling I can't even relax with a smoke without exiting the airport and facing the happy crew again to get back in. Regrettably I am due to transit through this Mickey mouse airport again this year but I will make efforts to change to Vancouver. Avoid this place if possible.
The walk from your international flight to customs is excessive. I can normally handle some walking but this is awful. I need to stop numerous times just to rest. Every time I come through Calgary customs I swear I won't travel again but after a few months pass I gear myself up for the walk. May consider asking for a wheelchair next time. Will this improve with the new addition?
Going through customs takes about an hour then you get to security! Which takes an hour. Above all that you have to verify your passport at the gate. Now you get to the gate and decide you're hungry. You walk past your gate and see a nice looking sandwich shop and a couple of shops behind a glass wall however there is no door to get to them. If we can't go to some wing of the airport don't show us! Avoid this airport at any cost.
The slowest airport! To go through US custom declaration it takes about 2.5 hrs. Domestic security check takes about 40 min. The security staff are rude and disrespectful. If you have been to Las Vegas expect a full search and invasion of privacy. Airport parking is by far the most expensive in North America.
Calgary Airport: first you have to walk several minutes to get to customs. It is usually a different route with a variety of hallways. Then you wait for your bags for 40 minutes. The sign of course tells you that your bags will be 4 minutes. Eventually the explanation provided is that there is only 1 ground crew. Surely planes are scheduled and that bags will be on the plane can be anticipated. This is a business run it as one and not as a government entity where there is simply no responsibility.
I have been going to Calgary airport for many years because I lived in the nearby city Lethbridge and I have had excellent service with this airport. The toilets are cleaned every 1 hour and they are well cleaned and the airport itself has easy access for the disabled.
The airport was very clean but the food that was available was not so good. It was very nice to have the Spaceport so the kids can play. Overall this was a very good airport.
"Overall Calgary is a pretty good airport but food service on the international side is horrendous. ""The Pub"" (why it's named that I have no idea) is some of the worst food you will have in an airport. The other choices are Burger King and Tim Hortons. They have very limited seating. There is no access to the Air Canada lounge from the International side either."
I had my flight cancelled first thing (9am) Sunday December 30th with no options but to fly out later that night (10.30 pm). Security staff were most accommodating in allowing me to go back through the security check despite the fact I was flying out much later that day. I had checked out of my hotel and really had no other option than to stay in the airport during this time.
I fly to and from here 4 or 5 times a year. Queues at the check in counters are usually short and staff are friendly for the most part. The airport is clean and if you have any questions you can get help. Security and border staff are usually pretty friendly. There is a very big selection of places to eat whether you want a donut and coffee or you want a full meal - you'll find a lot of places to get some food. Duty free prices are very very cheap. Lots of seating available throughout the airport. Free high speed wifi is available and always works. 30 minutes of parking is free at the airport and there are lots of long-term parking choices too. Baggage comes out really fast most of the time. Highly recommend this airport - it's excellent.
Even though it may lack in some things as size and entertainment it makes up for it in others as soon YYC will soon be able to handle A380's and 747-8 plus a new terminal and runway. There has only once in my lifetime been a big issue with this airport and that was easily resolved!
"The first airport I ever did a connecting flight in so obviously I was a little nervous getting there however the majority of the staff was helpful in directing a poor lost person in the right direction. The layout was sometimes confusing and I had a difficult time trying to find customs but it's a beautiful well kept airport with lots of shopping and restaurants to keep you occupied. And might I add the most comfortable seating out of any airport that I've been to. The only issue I had was after I found my gate and waited out my 3 hour layover I discovered that they'd put the wrong gate number on my ticket so when I approached the man at the desk of the gate my boarding pass and the electronic boards said I needed to be at and asked him where I should be he replied ""I don't know"" and dismissed me. So I almost missed my flight trying to find the appropriate gate. However overall I would say that this is a beautiful fast and mostly friendly airport which I would definitely return to in the future."
I fly out of this airport at least once a year with WestJet airlines and I am always impressed right from the check-in counter all the way to the gate. It could use more short-term parking though.
Nice airport until you get into the security zone. Was transferring at this airport. It has a bit of an odd setup. It feels like a big long strip mall. It was quite a hike from where the plane let me off to customs. Decor and overall quality was good. After customs the main part of the airport is nice. Good restaurants in the food court and an excellent view while eating. Security was pretty brisk. One warning though. After you get through security the gate area is almost devoid of bathrooms! There is one bathroom upstairs and one downstairs this was for hundreds of waiting passengers. Overall not bad but please Calgary install a couple more toilets.
We arrived from Kelowna at 8.30am on a Saturday to catch a connecting flight to Orlando at 9.45am. To claim our bags prior to US customs we had to get past others that were lined up drag luggage back around people in line then watch while others barged ahead of everyone. The layout of that area could be improved greatly. There was a very long line to enter customs and when we finally arrived at our gate the flight was already boarding. While the airport appeared to be nice and clean I will avoid it in the future if we have a US connection under 2 hours.
Going through US customs was ridiculous. If this is the city airlines choose to fly so many direct flights into the States from the prairies the airport needs to streamline this process to get passengers through in a more efficient/timely manner. Delayed flights/connections are the biggest frustration for a passenger. I have flown into many larger airports that get this done.
Arrival baggage service is the slowest we have encountered versus 14 other international airports. We have regularly experienced 25 to 30 minute waits for luggage at Calgary International. No excuses for an airport so relatively new.
Internal flight. Airport is clean and welcoming. Check-in good. The departure areas are clean with adequate seating. Free wifi.
The terminal is quite small for a city of it's size. There is not a lot of shops except for the occasional Tim Horton's. However I've never had any problems with check-in customs line ups and security. The good part is that customs are very fast and efficient in the airport because it's not as busy. I think the terminal is in need of major renovation.
In arrivals there are plenty of people in cowboy hats who can offer assistance if you get stuck with anything which is useful. You can buy a day pass for $8 from Mac’s convenience store. Unfortunately the bus is the only means of transport to downtown and express buses run every half hour to downtown. The departures area was more modern than arrivals and there were a good number of places to eat and shop after passing through security (no problems there). The airport itself is fine but for the lack of a direct rail link from the airport.
Recently flew into YYC on an international flight and then out again a few days later on a domestic flight - on the whole I found the experience to be rather good. I love the fact that they have the friendly greeters in white Stetsons it certainly makes you feel you have arrived somewhere different also love the fact that they help people with mobility problems or young children by giving them a lift on the golf buggies from the airbridge to customs. This was brought into sharp contrast on arrival back at Manchester with the ludicrous up and down stairs long and winding walk you have to do on arrival. The customs guys were certainly abrupt but no more than I had experienced in other parts of Canada - in fact they only asked us 2 quick questions before letting us through - other groups of passengers seemed to get far more of a grilling. Baggage reclaim was really fast signage to rental cars was easy to follow and I'd say we were completely out of the airport within 1hr of landing which is not bad at all. Flying out was positive too - had heard rumours that the security staff could be quite rude but if anything they were a bit too friendly. Decent selection of shops and food outlets and a great seating area with nice views of the airfield and the Calgary skyline in the distance. Very good experience on the whole.
Re B Cronin's comments on Calgary Airport Customs staff
Decent airport with very good shopping options (primarily before security). Newest concourse D is quite nice. Some parts really showing their age - US departures area is utterly awful as are B gates. Also a total lack of any real services or shopping in the C (USA) gate area. U.S. Customs clearance wait times can be horrendous. Wayfinding signage is ridiculous awful horrible amateur in some places! Best example: exiting the customs hall. When the first batch of amateur signage confused passengers they put up more. That clearly didn't help so they put up more. Then somebody installed red LED signs with flashing words and arrows (which are just as poorly designed as all of the other attempts). Now someone else has tried to rectify by putting up handmade and laser-printer-ed signs. The signage is so bad that it's laughable but it's also a sad way to welcome people to Calgary.
Calgary Airport is an efficient airport and should allow rapid transit for visitors and business people alike. I have one problem which happens every time I arrive at Calgary and it continues to astonish me and upset me every time it happens. I arrive on BA flights direct from London once or twice a year. We are greeted by the friendly folk with the cowboy hats and then to the customs officers where the hell begins. Of my last seven visits I have been treated with a level of hostility abruptness and intrusiveness that leaves me flabbergasted. On Saturday the customs official tossed my documentation back at me it actually fell off the counter. On a previous two occasions I was sent to the 'back room' for a grilling. Beware not crossing a line with 'do not cross until called' sign (usually swinging to the side unseen). Even it there is no queue under no circumstances approach the officer unless they call you forward. On Saturday she seemed peeved to have lost the opportunity to berate me. Oh yes visitors to Calgary beware. For here you may find the most sour deliberately antagonistic unprofessional and deeply unhuman officials. If only the lovely citizens of this great country knew how some visitors were being treated in their name.
Our journey to Calgary and passage through Canadian Customs was happily achieved with no delays with no waiting lines and up to ten Canadian Customs officers on duty. Our return trip from Calgary to Philadelphia via Chicago was very trying for many reasons. We arrived at YYC at 2 pm two hours before our flight to learn that our flight was delayed to 5-20 pm. Although a sign stated that we were barred from entering customs until two hours before our flight time no one advised us that it would take more than ninety minutes to pass through US Customs and YYC Airport Security. We entered US Customs at 4:00 pm at which point the waiting line was backed up outside the door from the terminal with only two US Customs officials on duty and a third serving flight crews and a supervisor doing nothing. There was a fourth official person circulating through the waiting crowd assuring all that no one would miss their flights. We asked him about our Chicago flight and he assured us that our flight would not leave without us. A full one hour later we finally got to the front of the line cleared US Customs and proceeded around the corner to arrive at YYC Airport Security and we realized that there were three lines open and only one of the lines was actually moving. It took 40 minutes to clear Airport Security who were opening every single bag and patting down nearly every passenger
Used Calgary airport for our departure point from Canada. We were dropped off by coach at ground level took some working out to departure level. After that check in for BA was a breeze security smooth but disappointed with the departure lounge several eating outlets not much choice for shopping the lady in duty free shop put me off by asking if I was on a international flight or else should get moving I thought she was closing the shop left without spending any money. This is probably due to all domestic and international flights leaving from same departure area.
"Calgary is one of the better airports around. Baggage delivery was prompt after arriving on domestic flight. On departure getting through security was a quick and painless experience. Passengers departing from the ""D"" concourse can avail themselves of the various airside restaurants and shops. Comfortable armchairs set up around the concourse are a pleasant alternative to typical uncomfortable departure lounge seating. Large quantities of natural light in the ""D"" concourse also nice to have."
Flew Frankfurt-Calgary-Edmonton. Arrived in Calgary at 4pm. Customs took seconds and our bags arrived within minutes of deplaning. Connection staff were slow though. 2 staff using paper lists to find all connecting passengers. Air Canada concierge working there helped us get booked onto a new flight at 5 pm.. We had to speedwalk not run accross the airport and re- clear security. Directions were clear but the airport looked dated. Security at A gates was very slow as we had an hour total in calgary. Area for Commuter planes gate A8 was small but fine. After a quick walk out to the turboprop we were on the plane by 10 to 5 so from getting off one plane clearing customs rechecking our bags clearing security and getting on the next flight it was 50 minutes. Amazing.
When Air Canada informed us that our flight times had been changed leaving us under 90 minutes between the arrival of our flight from Houston and the departure of our flight to Vancouver I was nervous since we'd have to go through Immigration and Customs and get to our new flight but the airline assured me it was plenty of time. We passed through Immigration and Customs very quickly (I have a U.S. passport and my wife has a Brazilian passport and U.S. permanent residency card) and then walked briskly over the long distance to our departure gate. We made our flight with time to spare (not a lot of time mind you but enough to allow a quick trip to a rest room before boarding was announced). I can't comment on most of the airport's facilities but at least in our case transiting was fast and easy.
I cannot agree with these comments. I am a British citizen living in the States and every time bar one that I have entered Canada at Calgary airport (via Chicago) at immigration I have been told to go to the separate office at the back behind immigration. There I have had to wait for ages before being questioned in detail about my purpose in visiting Canada. I have seen this happen to other visitors too. I am fortunate to have travelled all over the world in my life and I have not experienced this at any other airport ever. Next time I have to go to western Canada I will go another way perhaps via Toronto even if it takes longer.
Nice building but it's a bit of a walk if you're connecting between Concourse A and D. Shopping plentiful outside the secure area and prices reasonable. Airport volunteers in cowboy hats add character to the place.
"Adequate building overall but about the ""Stetsoned Welcomer Wagon"" people: Rather than a nice touch it's like being cornered by some kind of cheerleading mascot. Some people's idea of fun perhaps. I also note the lack of a needed rail link here as even though it's a small city the traffic is an honest concern (throughout not just to the airport.) Air service is adequate for North America."
After our negative experience at JFK Calgary airport was a wonderful breath of fresh air. It didn't take long to go through customs where the staff were friendly and approachable. The staff with our coach to Banff (2 hours away) were lovely and during our 40 min wait we had coffee and actually relaxed. Getting our luggage was quick too.
"It is always a pleasure to fly into Calgary or Vancouver airports. The red waistcoated and stetsoned ""welcomers"" are a really nice touch and very helpful for information. Had a 7 hour lay over in Calgary. The airport is clean and shops are interesting. We spent a couple of hours having lunch in a proper - non food court - restaurant which helped time pass. We also like being able to store our luggage until it could be checked in at a reasonably modest charge. 7 hours lay over in an airport is never fun but if you have to do it it's a much better experience in Calgary than elsewhere."
Flew in from JFK - small but clean and efficient. On the way out check in staff really nice no charge for overweight bag. Lots of glass so you have a view. At least some shops before customs. Customs Official very rude on way out but it was US customs so you expect that from them! Lady who checked my bags was nice though. Not much to do after customs except have a beer or a tea. Overall a pleasant experience.
"We were impressed by the cleanliness of the airport and the warmth of the welcome from a number of Calgary ""Ambassadors"" dressed in red uniforms with white cowboy-style hats. There was a very brief wait at Immigration Control and the official there welcomed us to Canada and wished us a great holiday! Baggage came through quickly (Premium Cabin luggage priority labelling obviously noted and dealt with!). Onward transport to the local Hotel was meant to be a courtesy coach but we were given a limo instead! One of the best Airports I have been to!"
Calgary Airport has an excellent assortment of shops and services. I was there for 4 hours one morning because of a flight delay. The general public has access to a food fair airplane model store Virgin records Purdy's Chocolates to name a few. It definitely has more to offer than Vancouver or Alberta's provincial capital Edmonton's lousy airport. No wonder Calgary gets the bulk of Alberta's air traffic. I enjoyed the large windows to view arriving and departing aircraft. The FIDS screens are colourful and easy to understand.
Having just transited at Calgary going from YEG to LHR I was taken somewhat aback by the barren wind-scorched terrain in Calgary. In stark contrast to the lovely forests snowy fields and overwhelming pleasantness of Edmonton Calgary looked dead brown and broken up only by the uninspired warehouses typical of industrial airports. This isn't to say it was a bad terminal quite the opposite it's assuredly as uncrowded and efficient as everyone has said but on the airside it truly is boring the staff seemed plastic and the view was simply painful. While from the moment I touched down in Vancouver I had been spellbound by Canada Calgary was a truly unexpected sendoff from an otherwise gorgeous nation.
Although Calgary’s airport is not nearly at the level of Canada's gateway international airports of Toronto and Vancouver. They have a very nice small airport on the Canadian prairies. The best thing about YYC is it has light traffic so if you have to make a connection at YYC getting to your gate is quick and easy - no mobs of people like the big city airports and you don't have to take a train/bus to get to your gate or terminal.
The airport has become a destination for travellers visitors and locals. Renovations are not quite (if ever) complete but this is one of the best designed facilities in North America. Great selection of shopping on both sides of security in all terminals (ABCD) with hours slightly reduced as late night/early morning traffic dictates. YYC is run as a business and is attracting non flying public with cheap evening parking attractions and restaurants.
YYC is a great airport having just at the end of renovation the airport is clean modern and classy. Concourse A B and C are slightly older but still are better than what you would find in Toronto or Vancouver. Lots of shops lots of food courts and there are tons of comfortable seats.
Found YYC to be a pleasant place to transit from an Air Canada Jazz flight from YQU to the intercontinental Air Canada service to Frankfurt. There are some big comfy leather seats in the departure lounge to relax and to have a look out on the apron. Mostly short ways only if you have to connect between A and B you have to start walking some 5 to 10 minutes before bording. Only downside is the lack of restaurants ( only two Tim Hortons and a bar) after security where you normally are while just on transit. I liked this airport and will use it again in summer to connect. Air Canada Maple leaf lounge is a pleasant place to stay while you wait with all the services you need and expect.
Beautiful airport post renovation much of the Canadian departure areas have been upgraded and atriums/walkways are spacious and bright. Many new shops and exhibits. security and other ground staff are friendly as always. However what still needs to be updated are their US departure lounges. Cramped dark boring. But overall a league above most N.American airports.
It has far more services than many other larger airports and yet due to its medium-size does not suffer from overcrowding. Nice features include a stunning central lounge atrium with water fountains and a huge glass facade with amazing views of the city and airplanes spa post-office free baggage carts hotel within the terminal complex with calming atrium portable DVD player/movie rental multiple restaurants great selection of stores aviation/space exhibit for the kids and plenty of free outlets to plug your laptop in. I much prefer to use a well-serviced medium-sized airport like Calgary than the big hubs.
Calgary doesn't have the size benefits of Vancouver or Toronto but then it doesn't suffer the opposite of being too busy. The immigration staff at Canada customs are a breath of fresh air compared to US airports (and NZ) we've never had to wait more than 10 minutes in line (and they have also learned to smile!). Now the refurbishment is nearly complete the access and services are greatly improved we still enjoy travelling through there.
YYC is a above average airport. The terminal itself is under renovation. The Westjet terminal is great with some dinosaurs exhibits on the roof. The only problem is during the peak hours for Westjet departure the waiting area can be very crowd and not enough seats for everyone to sit comfortably. Also the departure hall check-in desks in area A B & C are all poorly design and passengers are not easy to access to their check-in desk whatever which airline. The design also affect the efficiency of passenger's movement. But generally speaking YYC is a good place to go through with enough shopping and dining when consider YYC is not a popular transfer airport. People just stay in the airport for a short while an extensive shopping and dining facilities are not really necessary.
Good airport but will agree with the others everything is landside and the airside is quite boring. Air Canada closed the only lounge in the US departures section in April so no lounge this time. The airport is under renovation so I will give them some credit. The lines for US customs were too long. They open the US customs hall at certain times of the day before a bank of flights and everyone stands there waiting. Otherwise great airport good shopping and very friendly staff. I am sure when the construction is over it will be magnificent.
Calgary isn't the biggest but is my favorite airport. Terminals are nicely laid out passenger drop-off is easy and yes those Smarte-Cartes have yet to invade meaning that you can get a baggage cart FREE! Check-in works well and the first-class lounge is very nice. Customs clearance is easy coming to and from the United States and there are many food service venues.
The US departures section is poorly designed and looks ancient! The whole airport seems designed for the people who send off travellers - once you head through the gates there is absolutely nothing to do! Having said that it IS undergoing renovation so hopefully it'll only get better.
Just a breeze to navigate. Spacious clean low stress. Good views of runway and stands. Limited shopping/food options. Security not highly automated (a lot of manual pushing and shoving of trays).
Very large airport for flights it handles check in easy airside facilities rather limited for a brand new terminal.
My word the new terminal has capacity that won't be needed in Canberra for 50 years! And I think I saw a sign predicting another new terminal on the DFO side that would just be ridiculous. So it's great for passengers at the moment - huge amount of space short queues for everything lots of road access and parking great views of the runway good lounges. Perhaps the increase in size has made it less clear where to go for things like taxis and hire cars and I don't think they've finished all the signage yet.
Compared to the poor and cramped small terminal that used to be here the newly built terminal has fresh and airy conditions and quite good facilities. However an annoying issue is that now Canberra Airport's Terminal managers have decided to play terribly loud music through the main buildings. Why on earth this decision has been made is beyond me - it certainly doesn't fit the style of the average passenger passing through this terminal. Indeed its enough to make me try avoid this terminal and make a point of not buying anything from the commercial outlets. Otherwise drop-off and check-in facilities are good security is efficient and air-bridges and staff appear mostly efficient.
The new terminal is a revelation compared to the old cramped terminal. Bright and airy easy check-in excellent club lounges bright gate waiting areas easy boarding this is the way an airport should be. Only hassle at the moment is the location of the taxi stand but once the whole airport redevelopment is finished this will not be a problem.
The New Canberra airport is much improved on the old one. The nation's capital finally has a decent airport. Easy check-in area good airline lounges easy boarding process. very impressed.
Landed in Canberra from Melbourne on Qantas and taxied in to the new Canberra Airport Terminal. I was told only departure lounges for Virgin Blue and Tiger airways were still in use in the old terminal however all airlines had check-in and baggage claims in the new terminal. A magnificent improvement from the glass aerobridges to the large glass panes that covered the walls of the terminal. Larger Shops as well as a conveniently located coffee shop were also noted. There was a much larger seating capacity than previously. On the exterior the terminal was extremely fancy and had newly implemented elevated roads to the departures level. All in all a superb terminal with fancy design extravagant interiors and modern facilities.
"Day return from Sydney - only had hand luggage so straight off plane (airbridge) and into terminal. Bus fare seemed reasonable ($9 one way $15 return) but I wasn't aware until told by a policeman in the terminal that it was a public holiday so bus service to town was infrequent. He told me where to find the bus stop (easy enough) but there was no timetable! I got a taxi instead. Departure was rather more troublesome - I had checked in for both flights in Sydney so didn't need the check-in facilities at CBR but finding a seat that was out of the quite fierce sun was rather difficult. Food prices were also high ($6.50 for two sandwiches $3.50 for a small bottle of soft drink). Then when I went through the scanner for security everything I was wearing set it off! I had to take off my belt then my shoes but it still beeped because I have metal pins in my feet. When I asked why I had not had any similar problem at SYD I was told ""our scanner is more sensitive!"" Way too sensitive is more like it. No airbridge this time - just a very short walk to the plane. It seems a nice enough airport but I have to deduct points for no bus timetable security and the over-priced food."
Checked in for my Qantas flight with Quickcheck which was very efficient. Then a short trip to the bag drop counter and we were on our way up the escalators to the gate lounge. Hardly anyone around and we were surprised that there weren't any kiosks or cafes to grab something at. However there was plenty of seating. I'm told that the Virgin area has a bit more activity as well as a cafe or two. You'd hope this little airport doesn't become a MEL or a SYD anytime soon.
Flew into Canberra on Virgin at 8.40am on a wet Friday morning 25/8. Virgin uses common user area and was only flight there. Bags off very quickly as lightly loaded flight and majority of passengers only had hand luggage. Rental car desks easy to locate and terminal well sign posted . About a 200m walk to rental car area mainly under cover. Arrival was all in all quick and efficient. Noted signs and announcements for bus service to city centre $7 one way or $12 return with service every half hour is quite good. Departure again very easy as not many Virgin flights in and out of Canberra. Warning - Check gate number carefully as Qantas use seperate departure area from others and they are not connected! Why they dont connect them is beyond me as it would save money by not having to double up on security staff and shop staff! Bar/snack counter in Common user area doesn't open until one hour before flight so if you are early stay landside if you want to eat or drink!. Terminal clean and bright with good view of apron area. Canberra is an efficient airport coping well with its current number of pasengers.
Unlike the DJ terminal in SYD CBR with its renovations is well light including plenty of natural light. Cleaners do an excellent job: SYD and to a lesser extent MEL and BNE take note! The coach service to the city remains inadequate: only an hourly frequency at most times on weekdays and no services on weekends and no pickups en route from 'Civic' (city) at places like offices in the suburb of Russell for instance. The urban otherwise excellent ACTION bus network should ideally serve the airport even if private operator Deanes presumably have the historic traffic rights.
I recently went through CBR on a Holiday to Canberra It is a nice Airport and terminal better than my home City Townsville but it looks to be revamped a little maybe replace the Aerobridges and Check-Inns Townsville even has newer Qantas Check-Inns and modern Aerobridges don't know about the Virgin Blue side though.
Yes the international flights started up a month ago you can now fly from CBR to NAN (I think that's right for Nadi) twice a week (Thursday and Sunday) at 1.30 pm. It's all very well set up like a production one minute they've got the customs set up and quarantine etc etc and half an hour later it's all gone again. You'd never know it was an international airport for one hour.
Went through CBR to fly to Melbourne for the Easter weekend. QF check-in staff member was very hospitable and I checked in with no fuss. Security staff friendly and I hope CBR stays this way. To be honest I wouldn't really want it to become another MEL or SYD or BNE.
Had the pleasure of visiting Canberra recently and I found the airport quite pleasant. The staff were also friendly and very helpful. I read in a local paper about plans to introduce international flights which I think is a great idea.
Canberra is my home airport and I generally agree with Paddy Ward that it is a nice airport. I have also found the staff to be friendly and accommodating. The Qantas check-in staff always try to get you a good seat for the international connections out of Sydney or Melbourne. The facilities are quite good with separate gate areas for Qantas and Virgin Blue/Regional Express. My only gripe is the stupid policy that only allows you to drop-off near the terminal but not pick up passengers and their luggage even if they are waiting at the kerb. This is supposedly for 'security reasons' but why then do they allow drop-offs. I believe that it's so the airport operators can rip you off for parking which has a minimum charge of $1 even if you stay for only one minute.
Although it isn't actually an international airport Canberra is a pleasure to pass through. Staff are friendly services are plentiful and it has good vibes about it. I invite others to share their experiences about Canberra airport.
I flew down mid week on Wednesday arriving around 2 pm. Sat on plane for 30 minutes on taxi-way waiting for a parking space. Then utter chaos. No restrooms. No air conditioning. People crammed in a space that was totally disorganized. It took 3 hours from exiting the plane to walking out the door of the airport. Utter chaos. I've never seen anything like it. I will never return.
"Cancun airport arrivals is absolutely horrible! I have been through this airport dozens of times over two decades and nothing has changed! Plan to be processed for at least three hours. The problem here has consistently been complete and utter lack or organization and not enough staff and officials to process people. On top of that they just don't care. The airport authority doesn't care and that filters down to all the staff and immigration guards. I am not an airport official but I am an efficiency expert in my field of work. I would love to have a week in this airport and overhaul all of their processes! New cash grab! Smokers do not bring more than one carton of your homeland cigarettes through this airport! They will fine you 500% of the value of one carton for the excess. They consider it ""foreign merchandise"" and it will be taxed. I watched dozens of people utterly flabbergasted by this new tax grab. Be prepared to have all of your bags and luggage rescanned and searched. The trouble with these officials is they don't get the difference between what is coming into the country and what is being taken out. The exit process from Mexico is far easier and less time consuming! Like everything else in this country the Mexicans try to do things like the rest of the world but they don't quite hit the mark! Be prepared to have tons of your time wasted unnecessarily!"
Arrived on a Tuesday in April around 11am local time. Sailed through immigration baggage pick-up and customs. Only hold up was filling out the forms since AA did not give us them on the airplane. From airplane to meeting our ride was 20 minutes. Departed on Saturday at 2.30om. Arrived at noon and almost did not have enough time. Waited to use the kiosk to check in. Waited almost 1.5 hours to drop bags off. Waited again for security. Airport was a complete zoo with nowhere to sit. Crowds everywhere and organization was lacking. Sound level in Terminal 3 was almost deafening. My ears ached by the time I got on the plane. Don't leave on Saturday afternoon if you want this experience at the end of your vacation!
It took us 3.5 hours to get through passport control. There must have been three or four planes landing within the space of a half an hour. The place was an absolute cattle market no air conditioning a sea of hot sweaty miserable people. The Customs staff appeared under manned or just couldn't care less. Although We loved the holiday I'm afraid we will never go back to Mexico or at least the Cancun area until this sorry excuse for an airport is either upgraded or redesigned it's not as if they don't have the passenger throughput!
Quite simply the worst airport experience I have had. Two hours two get through passport control. An absolute sea of frustrated hot and irritable passengers let alone tired screaming babies. Absolutely no sense of urgency from the few staff who were on duty and an overall feeling that was akin to a cattle market. Will never visit this place again!
My second time through this airport and nothing has changed for the better. Simply put the airport is not fit for purpose and the passenger experience is stressful and problematic when arriving. It is an absolute cattle market when trying to get through immigration baggage reclaim and then the awful customs (green light red light). Too many aircraft arriving together with too many passengers seeking to get out through facilities that cannot cope.
Travelled in Dec 2014. Hadn't been back here for a while so was surprised by the changes. Has to be the first airport that I have seen built inside a shopping mall. Even the boarding gates are hidden between stores. There are stores everywhere. What a zoo when its busy arriving or departing. Don't buy food inside the airport. Prices are ridiculous $23 USD for a single hamburger and fries. Can we all say Rip-off! Think I won't be back for a long while.
Used terminal 3 in November. Fairly modern terminal but with very limited facilities. The departure experience was far better than arrival. The departure hall was modern and clean and queue to check in or bag drop was not too long. Security check took a while but that seems to be the norm nowadays. There was a decent duty free and some shops after security. Nothing too interesting. Also few restaurants near the duty free. I visited the lounge which was poor - very limited drink and food and the seating area is dated. Arrival experience on the other hand was bad. Immigration was efficient but the luggage wait was long. I waited at least an hour to reclaim my luggage. After the luggage claim everyone has to go through the customs - the queuing system is bad and again the facilities not able to cope which results in another hour of waiting. And the entire arrival hall was chaotic.
"Flew into Cancun on Monday 1 September 2014 arriving at 11.40am. Customs hall was empty and breezed through bags were actually waiting for us in the baggage room and then onto the ""dreaded"" baggage scan pressed the button it turned green. From stepping off the plane to meeting our rep must have taken all of 20 mins. Departed 11 September 2014 at 10 am check in at the AC counter was quick as was security check. There is adequate shops etc in the departures lounge."
"I visit this airport at least once a year at times twice for the last 12 years. Very clean! Bathrooms are perfect! I have never been in that airport more than an hour fast and courteous staff. Only one time there was a long delay due to the computer systems being down that time we were stuck in the airport almost 3 hours. My only complaint is that at departure they have put self check-in kiosks and then they make you stand in line for 45 minutes to drop your bags off (AA specifically) - I wonder why they don't have a designated ""baggage drop-off"" counter?"
We landed on time from Manchester and was then forced to wait just over an hour in the aircraft on the taxiway because there was nowhere to park the plane. When eventually we did get landside a queue like never seen trying to get through immigration. The baggage reclaim had 3 flights on the one belt and then another very long queue to get through customs after of course having all bags scanned. Not good enough for an International Airport. Three hours from landing to leaving the airport (16.04.14).
I have been traveling to this airport for over 20 years and they have made significant improvements that translate to shorter wait times. I have never seen them screen every bag there must have been a specific reason for that. The best advice I offer is do not travel on Saturday. That is by far the busiest day with the longest wait times due to timeshare owners.
I was there in Jan and our flight arrived late night. The line at security check took us about 20 minutes and staff were very polite plus about 20 minutes to reclaim baggage. The facilities are clean but seem old. Outside there are a lot of tourism agents staff and people offering services. It was easy to find the tourism agency staff and took the bus to the resort. When I came back home my flight was delayed. I arrived to the airport a long time before check in and the airline booth was not settled but the electronic monitor was displaying were it should be. There is no seats available in the check in area. I found seats in the arrival area or we could go to restaurant and snack places. When time to check in came there was a long line. Don't forget to have the Mexican entry form with you to avoid delays at the check in. Staff were efficient and the security screen was smooth. After you pass security the airport is much bigger than it seems and is busy. At least the area we were domestic and International flights were departing frequently. Boarding areas had plenty of seats and there was a lot of places for food. However prices are very high. Restroom at the boarding area and general facilities are clean and big enough to handle its traffic. I found the announcements in English very difficult to understand due to low sound pronunciation and noise. However there was no problem talking in English on the information centre or with airline staff. 10 minutes before boarding the flight showed up on the gate monitor and after that we had 1.40 hr delay until boarding with no explanation. The airport seems to handle well traffic on a normal season but it may be overwhelming during high peak.
Took nearly 90 minutes to get through immigration and as we were leaving were collared by official looking people with desks in the building trying to get deposits off us for free excursions. On leaving we had to pay £50 each (1800 pesos in total) and then found very expensive food and drink in the departure restaurants.
Arrival was on 5 March 2013. Having arrived on a half full British Airways flight from London we were off the aircraft and through immigration within 20 minutes of landing. There was only a small immigration queue and passengers appeared to be processed relatively quickly and the immigration official was pleasant. Short wait for bags to arrive and we were through customs in less than 5 minutes - again the customs official was polite welcoming and helpful despite requesting an additional baggage search of the person that I was travelling with. My main criticism was after leaving the terminal building it was unclear where to go for onward connections using public transport. On the return journey the airport was extremely busy - long queue for check-in although the check-in agent and BA's ground handling team generally were pleasant and helpful. We were very grateful for a short and efficient security process. No BA lounge so used the TGI Fridays which again was very busy but decent food at an ok price as we had complementary BA vouchers. Decent range of shops and managed to find a postbox for my postcards despite being told by several airport employees that there was not one in the terminal. Boarding was crazy but thankfully I was entitled to use the priority line. My recommendation to avoid stress would be to arrive at least 2 hours before you are due to travel as long queues appear to be the norm at this airport.
We were prepared for waiting as it was Christmas week. It took us about 40 minutes to clear immigration which was fine. However when we reached the baggage claim it was pandemonium. The entire room was full and lines snaked everywhere. They were actually using X-Ray machines to screen every bag leaving the terminal. I have traveled extensively world-wide and know of no country that is doing this including the U.S. What could Mexican Authorities possibly think tourists are smuggling into Cancun on already screened Aircraft? It took us 1.5hrs to exit the Baggage area and from what we heard we were lucky. There was more danger created by the shear amount of people crammed into that baggage room than there ever could have been by failing to X-Ray bags leaving the Airport.
Immigration hell. Took us 2 hours 30 minutes to get through and others longer. Friends arrived two days before us and they had same experience so not a one off. Worst I have ever experienced in 35 years of travel.
Landed at CUN airport from a flight coming from Montreal. There was at least 30 minutes of waiting to pass passport control probably because there were many flights landing at the same time mostly coming from the USA but my bags were already out. Check-in and to clear security went smoothly. The terminal was not very big but it's pretty busy. Overall Cancun airport is not too bad and it has a couple of shops and restaurants.
Just returned this morning Cancun to Glasgow. Check-in at Cancun was shambolic as we had to join a queue leading to two premium seating check-in desks displaying on the monitor check in for Manchester and Glasgow. When we eventually got to a desk it was just a shambles the PHS handling staff member labelled our suitcases then for some reason lifted them off the conveyor and then just by chance after we arrived at the departure lounge we noticed that we had been allocated economy seating at the rear of the aircraft. After contacting a female member of PHS staff she managed to get our seating changed to Premium. Needless to say our two suitcases never arrived in Glasgow. So be aware if you visit Cancun.
Very nice well organized airport has improved greatly over the three times we have visited the area. However - do not purchase food or gifts at the shops. Lunch for 2 adults and 2 children $123. Purchased a few gifts once we got home noticed the suggested retail prices was whited out and we were charged double what it should have been. Very disappointing and has contributed to our decision not to return to the area.
"I use this airport several times a year. Though the name says ""International"" it is an ordinary US regional airport. The airport is served by feeder commuter flights for majors plus some mainline flights. A small restaurant and a few shops are at the terminal. The terminal is well kept and is connected to a parking building so that you do not have to go out during the cold winter. The free WiFi is available. I would like to mention that TSA personnel's at this airport are professionals and have never been unpleasant."
Cancun Airport This was a bright clean and friendly airport with a good range of shops and cafes. The staff were friendly and helpful. I flew in to Mexico via a different airport so my experience of Cancun is based on departures only.
This airport is new and is fairly easy to navigate. Parking in front of the terminal is excellent. I flew into CUN and had to stop at the agricultural inspection station because I had 4 cats. The agricultural inspector was very nice and my paperwork was in order but under current law each passenger is allowed only 2 cats so Aduana wouldn't let me take all of my cats out with me until necessary paperwork was completed. Overall the airport is excellent for facilities.
My husband and I departed the Cancun airport for Chicago just after the Christmas Day terror attempt resulting in increased security. We were prepared for the security delays and allowed time to pass through. The airport experience was uneventful. I have a titanium knee replacement and always get stopped at security! It's expected and never intimidating. However: During this time of heightened security I passed right through the scanners. Either the screeners didn't question what they saw or they missed it. It could have been a weapon! I am now concerned that I didn't mention this at the gate but I didn't . Just hoping that the airport officials read these comments.
Very impressed. Compared to Dubai airport (supposedly one of the best) it was excellent. Good places to eat and nice shops. Exceptionally clean toilets.
"Third world airport is a scary sounding phrase but Cancun airport doesn't deserve the scary reputation that this suggests. In several trips through Cancun in the past three years I have never had a problem. On arrival transiting through immigration was reasonably fast and checked baggage always turned up quickly. Sometimes (if your 'number comes up') Mexican customs makes a more thorough search of your baggage (including x-raying) but even this wasn't too much of a problem. On departure I’ve found that the airport processes people quickly and that security line-ups are minimal. There is plenty of comfortable seating in the departure area and many options for the shopper or traveller with time on their hands (including one of those typical Mexican pharmacies that sell just about any kind of drug without requiring a prescription). I only have two issues with Cancun: Firstly the number of time share hawkers waiting to pounce on you right after you exit customs some masquerading as representatives of the tour companies. Just ignore them and keep walking. The other issue is temporary – Cancun is building a new runway and the road network is a little messed up while construction is in progress making it slow driving in and out. In summary Cancun airport is easier to arrive at and depart from than a number of ""First world airports"" that I’ve travelled through in recent times and they should be complimented for doing a good job."
It's really a tale of two airports. The immigration and arrivals areas are bad. I arrived 3.5 hours ahead of the party I was meeting in Cancun. I went through immigration and started over to baggage claim. The people on my flight and I waited more than 30 minutes for our luggage. After that the challenge is dodging the timeshare hawkers. Right when you walk into the rental car area there is an area of bank teller like booths staffed with people who wave you over urgently as soon as you make eye contact. It seems official but don't fall for it. If you dont get stuck with that then there are people standing around who pretend they are going to help you to your rental car or to the transportation to your hotel but it always ends up turning into a timeshare commercial. Also there is no place to sit so if you have to wait for any amount of time you have to sit on the floor. I would suggest when arriving leave straight away from the airport and dont make eye contact with anyone! Just plow through to the exit. The departure area is much nicer. Pretty clean lots of shops and stuff. I was amazed at how decent it was. No problems with the departure process. Planes are slow to board. Security goes through every carry on bag as you board the plane. The beauty of Cancun far outweighs the bad stuff at the airport. Just get out of there as soon as you can and enjoy the paradise that awaits
Very pleasantly surprised leaving from Cancun. Bright clean and large modern airport. Check-in for XL Airways was quick and efficient no delays at security ample seating in area with shops and food outlets. At 11 pm currency exchange was still open.
"I suppose that I expected a bit more from an airport serving a major tourist area. First there is only one runway (which was closed for 20 minutes due to debris as we approached from Denver) and many of the gates have no jetways. When we departed we had to board a bus with no seats to be hauled to the far end of the tarmac to board our flight from portable steps. When you arrive you are besieged by people wanting to give you a ""welcome package"" - invariably people hawking time shares. If you have never been to Cancun before you have no idea that they are not affiliated with the company you booked your tours through. Very chaotic getting to ground transportation. This airport is decidedly third world which I found surprising."
Cancun Airport has undergone a great deal of improvement in the last year. Baggage reclaim was pleasantly quick and the immigration side is bigger and more efficient than previous years. They have X-ray machines now instead of opening everybodys case now but they still select many at random for close inspection which can delay you. The departure checkin desks appear on screen 3 hours before the flight but there was an hour queuing before the desk actually opened . The departure lounge in the international terminal has been vastly improved with a snack food court bar and a new duty free shopping area which passed the time quite nicely. All in all quite a good experience and much more efficient. There was no baggage search to delay checkin on departure this year but they still have a departure tax of $50 USD at check in !
Very impressed with the layout services cleanliness and comfort of the Cancun airport - well done. It certainly makes for an even better vacation experience.
I have arrived and departed via Terminal 2 (domestic flights) several times and it has been a decent experience. In fact CUN was making some progress previous to the Hurricane Wilma incident. The location of the airport is quite far away from Cancun but its in the center of the Maya Riviera complex. True many improvements can be made (especially when it comes to entertainment and ventilation) but it fares quite well compared to other Mexican airports. Transportation wise there are some problems but it fares better than Honolulu or San Diego.
"Cancun airport was very unpleasant experience. There were signs everywhere that said ""NO SMOKING"" but everyone was smoking. If you can't stand the smoke this airport will be a terrible place. There is no enforcement to prevent people from smoking. In addition ventilation in the airport is pretty bad which doesn't help this situation. I even asked the security guard about this and she just told me ""I am sorry""."
Cancun airport is OK. I arrived and departed through Terminal 1 which is the older terminal. Customs and Immigration on arrival was orderly and straight-forward. Departures were well-labeled and frequently announced. Transport from the airport to Cancun is frustrating as you are guided to the $60 taxis. There is no signage or other directions to the $1.50 shuttle that departs every half hour. (I learned about this only for my return) The trick is that the shuttle only departs from Terminal 2 so from Terminal 1 you must first take the inter-terminal shuttle. Also annoying was the chronic smoking in the terminal even at the gates despite 'No Smoking' signs posted everywhere.
Cancun airport is really operated quite efficiently not that improvements cant be made. I have been in and out of this airport for 15 years and have experienced it all. Everything is a matter of perspective Mexico is Mexico some things are to be expected and prepared for.
Cancun Airport has always provided exceptional service and a great experience. Terminal 1 is a bit old and always crowded but since I'm mexican I almost always arrive and depart from Terminal 2 which is a newer bigger and more modern terminal with a big round concourse comprising around 20 gates. The new baggage claim area is a total disaster they send 4 flights to the same conveyor just like in Mexico City even when there are many carousels left. Conveyors 15-18 are never used instead they exploit 1-10 and sometimes use 11-15. Organization is a big problem but its even a great and big international airport.
I flew into Cancun once from Charlotte. Customs and immigration were chaotic. Lines were formed all over. It took 2 hours to clear passport control. Check in was no problem at all.
Based on my last four visits to Cancun I would have to agree with the negative comments posted her by others. The exception - on 8th October 2004 I left Cancun for London Gatwick and everything went smoothly and quickly! We arrived at the airport about 90 minutes before our scheduled departure (charter Britannia BY362B 15:35 departure) and there was no queue at all - we walked straight up to the desk without our luggage having to undergo a manual search where we were checked-in quickly and we paid our departure tax there (none of the separate queuing as reported by Nick Williamson). The straight through to the departure lounge where we made some duty-free purchases and had a drink and then boarded the flight on time and departure was also on time. I guess that sometimes things work very well even in Cancun!
A wonderful airport to travel through except for the ridiculous amount of customs desks on the green lane when coming in from overseas. Are these people for real? Have they been given instructions to chase overseas visitors away? Surely South Africa needs as many tourists as possible? This is going to put the word out that they should avoid it for sure. I've had a couple of trips to Cape Town since Christmas and been stopped both times with no contraband carried. British readers would recognise them as 'Jobsworths' who need to tick boxes to keep their jobs. Very irritating and very intimidating.
Cape Town Airport was voted the best airport in Africa and it is easy to see why: it is fairly new very clean and very efficient. Employees are very friendly and the toilets spotless. The security is top notch and very efficient and fast (American airports could learn a lot here). The only down side is the arrival level: whoever designed it must have been drunk because when you arrive you have to walk to the far-end of the building collect your luggage and walk all the way back (can be as far as 800m)!
Security checks were lacking at Cape Town airport and did not come anywhere near the high levels experienced at other airports throughout the world. We took a flight on 3rd March 2014 to London. We were not asked to declare any liquids not asked to empty pockets or remove belts jewellery shoes coats or anything. Needless to say the scanner alarm sounded when we both passed through the arch due to the various metal items in pockets or on our persons. We were then very briefly 'patted down' as was every other passenger. I would be very uneasy about taking flights from Cape Town until they tighten up significantly on their security procedures.
Economy check in for a mid afternoon international flight was very disorganized and unsettling. Large numbers of people milling around aimlessly with no defined queue for check in. Lots of people were accompanying a single passenger to the check in counter and airline staff thin on the ground. It was unexpected of an otherwise really spacious and very beautiful airport.
Brilliant and efficient. No wonder this is the best airport in Africa. World-class facilities brilliant lounges and seems to handle passenger numbers easily (it was completely rebuilt for the 2010 World Cup). Centralised departure terminal on top floor with restaurants on mezzanine level. All arrivals on ground floor. Compact and easy to navigate. Lots of parking and connections to city (public bus / taxi etc) right outside the central terminal. After seeing my share of global airports I am proud to call this airport home.
Good for a small airport. International arrival was fine except for insufficient immigration staff. Domestic departure also fine: fast check-in and security spacious terminal and decent shops. Might not be able to handle an increase in passengers though.
This is a very clean modern airport and easily navigated. The only thing I would say that is negative is the lack of food outlets in the departure lounge.
Airport has totally been changed for past fifa world cup football. Airport can compete with any modern airport. Access is easy service fast and professional. Airport is clean and everything is widely available. Waiting area gives you a panoramic view of planes landing and taking off while waiting for your flight. Bars and restaurant are not cheap but cheaper then most other international airports.
Mango flight CPT-DUR. Checked in online picked up boarding pass from counter and issued return evening flights b/pass. Clean neat tidy spacious Central Processing Unit with friendly check in staff long early morning queues went very quickly with at least 6 X-ray machines operated by friendly staff on duty. ID check before easy boarding.
"CPT fully deserves the Skytrax rating ""Best airport in Africa"" - terminal building appears modern bright clean and friendly no long distance from VAT refund to baggage wrapping to check-in. I used the smaller international section where only merely 15 flights depart every day so no queues at security no queues at immigration no full lounges. Flew Turkish Airlines they use the Bidvest Lounge very friendly staff there choice and variety of their food could be better though. What a positive difference compared to busy Johannesburg."
A spacious and well lit airport (lots of glass allowing natural light in). Processing time on arrival rather slow (around 50 mins) so luggage had already been delivered by the time I'd exited the customs area. Check-in on departure quickly completed. All staff I encountered including those at the security checks were efficient and friendly. Sufficient shops to pass time away without them appearing to me too many. A very pleasant airport all 'round.
Really nice airport - clean and new with speedy transit both inbound and outbound. Only one issue - the cafe/restaurant in international departures woefully slow with disinterested staff.
CPT made my trip a complete pleasure! Getting to the airport was fast The CTB was clean modern had a very calm environment with lots of natural light. Check-in was fast. The lounges were relaxing the Nintendo wi facility was really fun. Boarding was fast. lots of duty free restaurants and bars. All were priced well. Friendly and efficient staff. A real experience.
CPT-Nelspruit JNB-CPT. Great airport efficient and friendly security and check in staff clean and modern. Lots of retail outlets on departures and arrivals.
Domestic departures clean and fresh. Good selection of shops restaurants and bookstores on airside. BA drop and go with no queuing. Arrivals terminal much improved since last flown before world cup. Baggage out quickly. Convenient store and food hall well positioned outside arrivals underneath departures hall. Noticed in JNB and CPT complimetary newspapers available in restaurants to the travelling public.
Better than ever! Check in is a pleasure. Finding and being helped at VAT counters too. Easy and pleasant security procedures.
"Arrived from KL and waited for my wheelchair to be brought to aircraft. Was told that baggage handling staff had ignored label attached and slung it onto the carousel. Waited until airport provided another chair pushed by helpful young lady whose name I have forgotten. Immigration hall appeared unmanned when we got there but we spotted a manned desk. Upon approaching we noticed that the adjacent desk was occupied by a large lady who was catching up on her sleep shaking the rafters with her snores. The surly attandant stamped our passports without a word. No ""welcome"" or anything like that - merely an attitude of ""how dare you make me work"". Retrieved my chair and trundled outside to find our son who was supposed to pick us up was not there. Upon phoning him we discovered he had been directed by ACSA staff to the domestic arrivals despite his explanation he was picking up from an international flight. No private vehicle access is available and it took the efforts of the cheerful lady to allow him through. This is the poorest service I have received at any airport having come through KL Hanoi Bangkok Phuket and Singapore airports where everything ran like clockwork compared to our fiasco."
Check in quick and easy security scanning quick and efficient and immigration a breeze. Other than that a wonderful revamped airport!
What a difference here. From a small uncomfortable airport in the mid nineties to a modern large facility matching many European airports. Excellent check in and immigration checks much faster than before. The shrink wrapping machine for luggage (recommend that you use it) takes a bit of finding now and is not signposted. Good experience.
Absolutely fantastic airport a great improvement on the previous International & Domestic terminals which were in turn the best airports in Southern Africa. This really shows Joburg Airport how it should be done. One mistake in the layout in departures there is no seating provision at all so families cannot sit down and have a precious moment before they separate something that upset my wife.
Cape Town International is a small and cosy aiport. Very efficient and encountered no problems when using it recently. Only short coming once airside very limited food outlets. Security and immigration officials very friendly and pleasant!
Cape Town International Terminal. Check-in at SAA swift with absolutely no queues. Security and passport control both efficient and friendly. Large and airey terminal space affords a pleasant environment. Only slight draw back is buses remain part of the course at CPT which is OK if your going on a RJ (one bus) but seems to take for ever if its a large airliner. Hoping the new terminal can mirror the old one but with airbridges!
I found Cape Town airport one of the better airports in South Africa. Did not have to wait ages for bags to arrive like other airports they were out in 5 mins through customs in under 10 mins and in a car to the hotel. Staff were so much more friendly than Johannesburg airport and the whole airport is much cleaner and easier to get around.
45 minutes to wait for luggage when only one international flight had landed is simply unacceptable or to quote the word which was one of the options on the SMS questionnaire that passengers can complete pathetic. Also the luggage was delivered to a different carousel to the one shown on the boards. The aircraft I arrived on (EK) was parked away from the terminal and we were bussed to the terminal. The driver did not bother to park close to the steps and passengers had to walk through puddles of rainwater. The airport has good facilities is extremely clean and immigration was reasonably fast. Large areas are still under construction and I prefer not to think what might happen with the 2010 football matches. It is clear though that they are making an effort and are responsive to feedback as I received a call from a lady at the airport not long after sending off the SMS questionnaire..
Despite the construction CPT domestic terminal is a cinch to get through. There's a short walk from the plane to terminal building and vice versa. The baggage collection area is a bit drab but our bags were out in about 10 minutes. On arrival there's a long walk from the drop-off area to the terminal building due to the construction but once inside no queues at all either in the check-in areas or in security. At 6:45 on a weekday morning we went from drop-off to the gate in 10 minutes flat. The porters aren't nearly as imposing as at JNB either. All common areas past security were clean and inviting with plenty of shops restaurants and seating.
Things have taken a turn for the worse while CPT is being rebuilt. Sign posting for the entry to international car hire return location is non-existent. We drove round in circles repeatedly and never found it and had to park in the short term car park. Avis staff were less than sympathetic although acknowledging the problem. The pedestrian route from the international car rentals location to the international terminal is also poorly sign posted. The queuing system a in the international terminal at security was badly organized.
Arrived at Cape Town International 2 weeks ago was a pleasant experience. Helpful and friendly staff. Departing from Cape Town International to London via Amsterdam was on the other hand an unpleasant experience. Checked in online but had to get the boarding passes at the airport. Lady who checked our passports/itinerary unfriendly almost rude lady at the baggage check-in wasn't friendly either.
I and my family use Cape Town airport 6 times a year at least. Friendly efficient and comparatively safe. Johannesburg on the other hand is fraught with sulky staff under-trained and very unsafe. We have been accosted in the lifts twice. And now there is the problem of people being followed from Johannesburg airport and hijacked.
I've travelled through this airport over the last 26 years and it's still a pleasure. Immigration queues struggle in the morning but staff are friendly and polite. Baggage is fast and efficient. Check in long haul - pleasant and efficient [hooray for BA online check in!]. The line after security gets longer every time I fly. Domestic flights: Check in - reasonably short lines but after security departures can be a bit congested so if you're at the front enjoy the lounges. Arrivals - what a pleasure bags there in no time. Shopping is reasonable but the international departures arrangement via the bus means a lot of time standing around in an otherwise empty departure area away from the restaurants and shops. About the only thing I can think of that needs improving.
Arrived and departed this airport with complete ease speed and helpfulness. The airport is beautifully clean and welcoming. I have used it many times on long haul from UK and it is a pleasure always.
Pleasant airport overall with nice open areas. The arrival coincided with BA but we were first and did not have any undue delays. On departure the computers were down so much was done manually but with no significant inconvenience.
After our overnight flight it was great to arrive in an airport like Cape Town. Small clean and easy to find your way around. Because our SAA plane arrived together with a British plane there were a few hundred people to go through immigration by passing only a few manned desks. Because I had had eye-surgery just 3 weeks before I could not handle the queues and was perfectly willing to sit them out on chairs next to the bathrooms. However within 5 minutes we were picked up and escorted outside to the car rental desk. Absolutely great. In Schiphol Airport people were nowhere near as friendly  attentive and helpful. Our next trip to S.A. will absolutely start in Cape Town!
Just returned from using this airport. Arrivals is still chaos with too few staff on and has been subject to many protests from local people. Departures was fine though on my day no queues and through with no delays at all. Used the Rennies lounge (also KLM & Virgin Business class lounge) this time and very good value for money. Can be purchased if travelling economy. Apart from arrivals no complaints.
Queues for International departures stretched from the ground floor through security to the Immigration departure Hall. Why? Just three of eighteen desks manned four long haul wide bodied departures at this time of day so maybe 1400 people departing within 20 minutes. Two flights were delayed because of this. Seems like inefficiency on Immigration's part as one airline rep said it happening all the time. Wake up Cape Town the African World cup is only just round the corner!
An excellent airport in all respects apart from limited catering facilities and one which has greatly improved over the thirty or so years I've been using it regularly. However I had an 'interesting' experience on Saturday night (24 SEP). Whilst waiting at the check- in to sort out a minor problem with my ticket I asked the lady if I could weigh myself on the baggage scale as I was curious to see how much weight I'd picked up on the last trip. My normal weight is between 64-66 kgs. You may imagine my surprise when it registered me as 47 kgs. I got on and off again with the same result! I told her jokingly that I would be happy to use that same scales with my wine laden overweight suitcase on my next trip. I then went to the next counter which showed my weight as 78 kgs (also twice.) A third and fourth one were correct. I do wonder if there is some sort of scam going on here as I find it hard to imagine that such a huge error could not have been picked up and addressed.
This was my first time in RSA and Cape Town was a good choice of entry. The building is spacious modern and light and I was through the busy and commendably thorough immigration section within 20 minutes which was impressive given the size of the queues. The only difficulty encountered was with the car park payment machines many of which seemed to be breaking down and which also accepted only a few values of notes resulting in long queues.
Each time I have flown in and out it has been easy. The lines moves quickly and everyone is friendly and helpful. Upon arrival after passing through immigration you proceed to the baggage carousel and hope that your luggage has made it to your destination with you but don't try to walk away with your suitcase that easily someone will be standing by to check your baggage tag and your passport.
Nearly two years on from the most recent review by A Hetier and much remains familiar at Maiquetia. Entering the country is easy and immigration is quick and friendly. Leaving the international terminal however is a far more stressful experience. The problem seems to stem from the multiple security agencies operating at the airport who often duplicate security checks. So one set of police screened everyone queueing at the check-in desk. Once in the customs/immigration area carry-on bags were x-rayed twice in rapid succession by two entirely different security groups. Then - and this was the real delay - passengers were called from the boarding gate in groups of 5-7 at fifteen to twenty minute intervals to go down to the working area of the airport for hand inspections of their already checked-in suitcases. I was in the penultimate group to be called down for an inspection at 6 PM - for a flight that was supposed to have left at 4:20. Some passengers claimed that TAP (with whom I was flying) and Iberia are singled out for this type of additional security check
One needs more than arriving 2 hours before take-off time for international flights. I would suggest 3. Queues are terrible everywhere (check-in taxes immigration). And why taxes can't be paid by card?! On arrival migration services seem more efficient (search me...) and luggage is delivered efficiently. It is a pity not to be able to get money from an ATM in the international space (only local cards seem to work). On departure when you pass migration you get into a renewed part of the airport with plenty of space totally different from the departure area which is crowed. Duty free shops are nice as well as the food offer. Some don't like the patterns on the floor of the departure area but it's one of the charms of Maiquetía airport. Another one is the take-off and landing especially at daytime. I always enjoy the landscape.
"Caracas airport despite many improvements still has a very long way to go to be thought of as anything more than adequate. The mad ""tax"" system where you pay to get out. A rather surprising total of six separate search points. The woeful queues at Immigration both inbound and outbound. The lack of a covered walkway between International and Domestic terminals. The constant unwanted attention from taxi touts and money changers."
"Despite the ""new"" international terminal ~ give yourself several hours to check-in. It took me 2 hours 15 minutes at American the other morning."
I've been in CCS many times and the improvements made to the airport are incredible. Very friendly and helpful staff. Still it is not a modern airport but manageable considering the amount of passengers. The only bad thing is that they are not paying attention to the security and when you are in the arrivals hall a bunch of people come and ask you if you want a taxi or maybe you want to buy the local currency - I undestand this due to the political situation the country is facing but as I always say it could and must be better.
I agree entirely with Fernando. Immigration staff also very helpful as well as friendly and efficient. Only problem now is the collapsed bridge on the road to Caracas. A diversion has been made but is only two lanes and is operated on a tidal system. Can add an hour or two to the journey.
I guess Mr. E Bernal hasn't been to CCS Int´l recently. This airport has been totally renewed. since June a brand new arrival area was opened with about 40 desks and very friendly staff. Deplane go through immigration and picking up your luggage takes about 20 minutes. So I recommend you to save those US$ 200 and continuing to fly through Caracas. By the way I did not know that there were flights from Maracaibo to Aruba.
I have flown into Maracaibo via CCS twice this year (both Air France) and after both experiences I have to remind myself to fly via Aruba next time even with the extra 200 EUR of flying KLM (AMS- Aruba). The reasons - All European flights arrive around the same time so you can imagine the line at the immigration counters. Of 10 desks on both times there were only 3 open. First time we queued for 1.5 hours (and the suitcases were waiting outside next to the belt). The second time we risked missing our connecting flight so an officer kindly let us skip the +2 hrs queue at the time we got on the line. The international and domestic terminals are not connected so when transferring it takes a 10 min walk (and carrying your suitcases) under a devil sun. You are not allowed to take the trolleys out of the terminals so the option you have (unless you carry it yourself) is to pay for a porter. I don't know how much it is since we decided to carry them ourselves. Be sure to cool off later on as the AC is barely noticeable inside the terminals. Domestic terminal same chaos as international. Upon departure make sure to check in as soon as it is open - same immigration queues! We were almost the first ones checking in and it still took us more than 30 mins to get through immigration! I must say however it is being remodelled and the new international departure area (before entering secure zone) has a nice food court incl Subway and TGI Fridays. Among others I have flown into Nigeria via Lagos and I must say Caracas is the worst airport I have ever encountered and will avoid it whenever possible. Departure tax is also more expensive than when flying out directly from Maracaibo (nice small international airport).
"On my last visit I found many issues which dismayed me regarding Simon Bolivar International Airport. (1) Only 2 ATM's in the entire international Terminal(side by side unsignposted and upstairs in the Mezzanine Level) - both ""out of order"". (2) Several Bank outlets in the main terminal concourses - closed in the middle of the day. (3) Inability to take luggage carts from the baggage claim area outside the exits into the main Arrivals Hall. (4) Excessive number of ""pushy"" unregulated (and mostly uninsured) taxi touts. The airport authority regulates (or attempts to) taxis and there is an offical Taxi / Transportation counter in the Arrivals hall. (5) On Departure from the country there is an airport user tax which must be paid prior to security / immigration. The organisation and collection of this farcical and woefully inadequate. In the airport's defense I would say it has one of the better Tourist Information desks of many South American airports but while the staff may be friendly and helpful there are all too few of them. Food selection and outlets are reasonable and shopping appears quite inexpensive."
It had been about four years since my last visit to CCS int'l and I don't really know what to think about it. The airport was or is being rebuilt and it looks really nice with lots of shops and everything but the staff are really rude and unkind. Four years ago it was all the contrary the airport was a chaos but the staff was very nice and polite. So - is that the price the airport has to pay so that it can be rebuilt?
The shops are nice and cheap and the staff = helpful and nice but the tax collecting system they have is ridiculous and unfriendly.
My impression was that the departing area is too crowded I consider CCS airport as big but definitively it urgently needs more space. The system they have to collect the taxes is inconvenient and archaic. Why don’t they just include all taxes in the ticket so that all passengers can avoid wasting their time that filling down those two forms causes? The departing area is ok pretty dark but it's impossible not to realize the amazing piece of work all along the floor made by a local artist. The airport has many cafes and restaurants and stores as well and although at first you feel a little scared because of the presence of military all around the airport the staff is incredibly nice.
Nice place to be with duty free shops that offer convenient prices. Pretty crowded but it's ok a little noisy but the airport staff are really nice friendly and helpful. It's being renovated so it's getting a new and very modern image.
A new arrival terminal is being built and a enormous area with restaurants stores and open spaces for the art was opened the last semester of 2002. They also built a conventions center outside the airport that is meant to be used as an area to receive important personalities of the politic and artistic world. Also the Hilton chain is building a hotel just across the street of the international arrivals. The international cargo area was massively expanded and they are also going to build another runaway. I think that such a modern city as Caracas really needed its airport to be renovated  besides Caracas Intl works as a hub for many European and Latin American airlines so the passengers traffic is being increasing during the last 5 years. What I would criticize of all this renovation is the fact that they eliminated the great open terrace from where you could feel the breeze of the sea and see the landing and the taking off of airplanes while having a cold drink.
"Having lived in Venezuela many years I've flown in and out of Caracas' Simon Bolivar airport many times. The airport was nothing special up until they began a massive renovation project a couple of years ago. A new hotel is being built at the airport and the international terminal is being greatly upgraded. Work should be completed soon but like many other projects in Venezuela it will probably be delayed some. Additionally the duty-free shops have been expanded and improved. The shops belong to the same chain of duty-free shops found in Spain's airports called ""Aldeasa."""
I found Carcassonne Airport to be very easy to use. My mother who has limited mobility has difficulty walking or standing for long periods so Carcassonne Airport which is tiny suited us very well. We didn't see a shop but we had something to eat there which was adequate. The taxi rank is just outside the building. We found Carcassonne Airport the taxi service and the Cite to be so easy to navigate and so hassle-free that we're going again this year. I would recommend Carcassonne and the airport for a short break as so little time is wasted at the airport.
Very small airport but that can be an advantage as it was for us. By the time we had cleared customs our bags were through and in 5 minutes were at the car hire office 50 feet away and on the road in minutes. On return no queuing to check-in and security took no time at all. Had good breakfast in restaurant upstairs. Only problem might be if more than one flight arriving or departing at the same time. Only complaint not enough seats once airside.
"Blast from the past with these reviews. I've recently been using Salvaza again as an alternative method to get from Liverpool to Toulouse though unfortunately it's getting worse. Nathan Fotheringill mentions in his review that he doesn't know how they would cope with two flights at the same time. The answer is ""with great difficulty"" Queuing up outside to check in was bad enough in the heat wouldn't fancy it in the rain at all. This was last Sunday (1st Aug 2010) with a Porto flight at 1530 & Liverpool one at 1535. 2 hours was only just enough time to get through the mayhem caused by the lack of signage and frustrated staff. Incidentally I'm not blaming the staff but the management who should seriously think of investing in this place before everyone starts abandoning it. Back to the old Manchester to Toulouse bit again. A bit more expensive but a lot more efficient."
Don't expect too much of this little airport but it is friendly and the departures lounge has expanded recently. At one time the only facilities were the toilets once you were through the security but now there is a vending machine for soft drinks and chocolate etc. The restaurant (upstairs) has a good menu and they are fully aware of the flight times so you don't have to wait for hours for your meal. There is one small shop (outside the security check area) which doesn't help if you want to take those items through with you that are ordinarily banned. The security staff also apply an interesting interpretation on what is dangerous: we had a travel iron confiscated from our hand luggage as it could be used as a blunt instrument. On the way back we could have bought one at Stansted - presumably traveling from the UK we weren't likely to brain anyone with it.
Nice airport. Staff very friendly and helpful. Nice restaurant food excellent and staff very friendly.
This airport is in need of some investment as the current building is barely adequate for a full 737-800 load of passengers. On arrival you will almost certainly have to queue outside to squeeze into the arrivals hall. Your bags should not take too long to arrive however. We departed on the 09:40 Ryanair flight to Stansted arriving at the airport two hours prior to departure as recommended. The airport was closed! The very nice restaurant upstairs is worth a visit after checking in - don't expect any facilities at all once you have passed through security. Our flight was only half full so there was plenty of room at the gate. A full aircraft would have made the place very crowded. I don't kow how they would cope with two flights departing at the same time.
Suffering under the strain of extra Ryanair flights the current extension works mean a marquee now covers departures. There is a tiny baggage carrousel which is woefully inadequate for 189 people arriving on a Ryanair 737-800. Hopefully when the works are completed they'll have created enough room for growth. Shuttle Bus to town (Stops at SNCF Station and 'Cite Medieval') for 5 EURO each way takes 10 to 20 minutes into town.
Great little airport clean well sign posted and accessible. There is no duty free but it does have a small shop selling local produce. On the upper level is a lovely restaurant and next to that a cafe/bar over looking the one runway. It's my favourite airport because it's so simple to use.
Small airport. Don't bother arriving too early for your flight as the shops don't open when the booking desks do 2 hours before the flight leaves. Absolutely nothing except toilets after customs.
"Hadn't been to Cardiff for a number of years due to poor flight choices. This time I was on Business. Great car parking and shuttle service. The security experience was horrendous. Staff were aggressive and patronising. As I had some liquids in my case, they quite rightly had to inspect it. However this was done in front of everyone with all personal belongings shown to everyone who was passing. It was an unnecessarily humiliating experience and easily solvable by having a screened area. The security staff were very unpleasant however and seemed to take great delight in ordering passengers around.  I might have thought this was a one off but on my return trip we were again 'barked at' and ushered unpleasantly and officiously whilst having our passports checked.  I will fly from Bristol or Heathrow from now on. I will not be going back. "
"Outward, my grumble was the extremely high prices for food and drink at the Echo bar! The return experience was the worst I've experienced. Upon arrival there was a very long walk from the arrivals gate to immigration where we joined a queue which took over 30 minutes to get to the front. There were 3 immigration officers on duty, 1 of whom just sat and looked at the queue and served no one. My hope was that with the delay in clearing immigration, our luggage would be on the belt. Unfortunately, this was not the case and  we had another 20 minute wait for the luggage (50 minutes after arrival!). After leaving the terminal, we tried to find the bus stop for the courtesy bus to car park 2. It was really badly signed and when we did get it's location verified by an airport worker, we had another 20 minute wait for the bus. To top it all, there didn't appear to be any visible exit signs, so another 5 minutes was wasted driving around. "
Very limited choice of shops and eating facilities compared to alternative airports.
Having decided to go to Prague for the weekend of my wife's birthday my children and I decided to do the costings as this was going to be her 60th birthday present. Can you imagine the shock that the price's quoted from our (local airport we live in Porthcawl) were so much more than the package we put together flying from Bristol including the parking and 3 nights in the Hilton in Prague! As the people of Wales airport you are a country mile from getting it anywhere near right.
After many years of using Bristol airport we decided to give Cardiff another go (we only live 8 miles from CWL). The main problem is the poor choice of flights but we managed to get a flight to Barcelona which almost fitted our needs. The airport's recent modernisation seems to be pretty good. Drop-off area was good and no charge (well done CWL). Check-in staff were fine security was no worse nor no better than most airports we use so all in all not bad. As part of the modernisation Cardiff seems to have followed the Bristol plan - enlarge the Duty Free shops at the expense of seating - not good. The catering is average but the prices are eye wateringly expensive over £2 for a cup of tea is such a rip-off. I thought the Welsh government owned this airport. They should stop such profiteering. Would we use the airport again. The answer is most definitely yes if suitable flights are available but that's the snag there aren't many flights to anywhere.
I was checking in my disabled grandmother and the staff were nothing but miserable rude and unhelpful. I saw a smile from one member of staff while checking in my grandmother and I felt we were made to feel a nuisance to these people. At one point someone told me to 'put her in a chair and take her to a desk!' Then they had a cheek to charge me 5 pounds for parking as it obviously takes longer to assist a person who requires a wheelchair. I phoned to complain and again felt the staff were not bothered and refused to refund me telling me to call another department. Not happy at all.
Much smaller than I imagined for a capital city airport and not one that I would want to be stuck in for too long as facilities are quite limited but overall a positive experience with short queues and friendly staff. A nice touch was a machine at the security exit allowing passengers to rate their experience. I hope these results are looked at and acted upon and believe that every airport should do it as it is often seems that it is this part of the travel process that determines how good or bad a passenger's overall experience is.
I will never use Cardiff Airport again. My wife and I have always used Cardiff for holidays but after being let down three times over one holiday never again. We are going to Bristol for the first time this year and even through its further away I believe we wont be let down. We have had our flights changed three times from Cardiff and we did not know what time we are supposed to fly or even if we can take two suitcases that we had paid for! I am sorry to say that I have lost faith in Cardiff airport. Is it any wonder people are going elsewhere? Also Cardiff is an international airport not a regional airport what a bad joke.
My experience of this airport was positive. I can't understand all the negative reviews trashing the place. Staff were friendly. Security also efficient and friendly. Seemed a little bit too quiet for a modern airport. I know they are trying to attract more business and I really hope they succeed. I'd read all kinds of horror stories about the place but it was fine. I'd been using KLM to travel into Bristol as it's usually a little bit cheaper but will definitely use their service into Cardiff again as it is closer to my destination.
We have flown from Cardiff airport for over 30 years. My mother and father used to fly twice a year back and forth between Dublin in the late 50's and early 60's and as a child I flew regularly between Cardiff and Dublin to visit family. As a family I my husband and my two teenage sons have used the airport since 2001. In December 2001 we flew on a day trip to Lapland. In 2006 it was with Thomson to Sanford Florida and experienced no problems. Again in 2008 to Sanford Florida with Monarch. In this occasion we arrived at the airport at 4am for our 7 am flight and didn't check in until 6.15 due to a computer crash. We then used the airport in 2009 to fly to Dublin. We didn't return until 2012 where we flew back to Dublin. We are flying yet again to Dublin in October this year and are hoping to have another stress free experience at this airport!
Very disappointed that since the take over of Cardiff airport no budget airline has returned eg. BMI Baby or would be nice to see Ryanair or EasyJet. Living in Wales we should be able to get flights for the same price as available from Bristol airport and not get the extra flight supplements also more competitive airlines than Thomson or Thomas Cook. I and many friends and family choose to travel to Bristol driving past Cardiff airport as there is usually a saving of at least £600 per family booking when travelling from Bristol with these airlines. Cardiff really needs to look at the services and flights available if it is going to develop in a competitive market.
I have just read the previous reviews and I'm sorry but I totally disagree with them! Quick check in quick through security yes they are strict but welcome to a modern safety conscious airport. Compared with some of the modern airports it could do with modernising however that really does not bother me. Parking was cheap at the Holiday Inn Express with a free taxi to the front door which took 2 minutes altogether. Cardiff airport has retained another passenger and would recommend to anyone else.
Dull ugly and (worst of all) the most unreliable and infrequent airport-to-city centre transport system of any airport I have known. Little wonder the airport is a white elephant recently bailed out by the Welsh Assembly government. You will arrive and discover that there are no taxis (these must be ordered) no trains (although there is a train link some distance away requiring a taxi!) and (most shameful of all) buses that depart once every 45 minutes! The latter are poorly signed and the whole this is a fiasco. I arrived on a flight at Cardiff Airport at 7.30pm and the terminal was closed. We were escorted through an area by airport staff to an exit and dumped outside to fend for ourselves (see above about lack of transportation). It was like flying to Uzbekistan circa 1953! I urgently recommend that you fly to Bristol instead then take the train. Failing that just don't go to Cardiff.
Being disabled at Cardiff airport is a nightmare. We leave the car at the highwayman parking their mini bus parks in front of the airport and this is where the trouble starts. I have to try and get a suitcase up 5 steps while walking with a walking stick at check-in it was not explained how far gate 13 was. The experience happens in reverse when I land surely slopes would be better then steps to the car park.
I have used many airports in the world and have had very different experiences in each. However Cardiff airport is unique. The infrastructure is dilapidated and reminiscent of some early Soviet political chambers. The shenanigans inside the building provided by the 'security' folk is astounding. A very unpleasant (and unnecessary) thorough frisking. The security staff were disrespectful and appeared to be jeering when the bleeper sounded at the security gate. It is the boat for me in future.
"We have used this airport on a regular basis and every time we are structure by how unfriendly most of the staff are. The security/customs people are rude and intimidating. The NCP staff unbelievably pathetic in attitude and all they have to do is authorise a pre booked ticket. We flew in from Amsterdam and what a contrast in how the Dutch run an airport. This airport is the ""gate way"" to Wales. What a bad advertisement. Its now owned by the Council. Tax payers money being wasted. Close it."
We regularly fly throughout the year from Cardiff or Bristol. Bristol airport lounge is excellent value however Cardiff airport lounge limits you to two alcoholic drinks! I do not want to get drunk at the airport but two wines or beers for my husband over 3 hours is pathetic! Out of curiosity I've clicked on the terms and conditions of numerous airports throughout the country and haven't come across any others that limit the drinks. Bristol airports 'Silver parking zone' is excellent and extremely well managed compared with what's on offer at Cardiff. Cardiff airport is supposed to be trying to encourage more people to use it but these are just two examples of why we prefer to fly from Bristol.
As I am a Welshman I am saddened to have to write a review of this nature about the Welsh international airport. I was unfortunate to use CWL for a return flight to Turkey recently. I had heard the news about difficulties at the airport and airlines pulling out but could it be that bad? A travel rep. told me they had difficulty selling flights from Cardiff and flights were being reduced. After being there I understand why! On arrival at the terminal I found that the check in queues for the Thomson desks were reaching outside the entrance. With travellers having to arrive up to 3 hours before flying and waiting for what seemed forever to actually check in the facilities for having a meal both before entering and in the departure lounge are very poor. Eventual boarding was good. On our return in the early hours of the morning the only flight to land waiting for our cases became an exercise in patience. Some cases would arrive and there would be up to a 15 min wait for the next batch (I think they were unloading using a wheelbarrow) in all for not a very big plane it took well over an hour to deliver all the luggage. It would seem on speaking to fellow sufferers this is the norm! Will I be using CWL again? Only if there is no alternative.
Be aware that Cardiff airport has now introduced a £2 charge for use of the luggage trolley - a 'trolley tax'! I was absolutely furious to find this new situation upon returning last Friday. All the other passengers were equally outraged. Clearly they want to lose yet more passengers. Next time we'll probably fly from London.
I used to use this airport on a regular (every week) basis changing in Amsterdam for my final destination. Over the years (last 10) this airport has become a disgrace. Starting with the primitive parking facilities - not so cheap - and security outside that would be acceptable to a US embassy - to the grotty interior underworked and over zealous security staff inside. I now get up 2 hours earlier and drive to Heathrow. Sometimes use Bristol - it's not bad at all and far superior to Cardiff.
"Despite it being the most local we'll take Bristol or Birmingham next time. Not content with ripping people off at every opportunity (parking drop-off fees etc.) now they charge for having those ludicrous ""security"" bags. However the real problem is the menacing security theatre. Getting menaced by them has become routine upon returning to Cardiff and it's not much fun on the way out either. Getting grilled with questions about our holiday time away business money spent purpose etc. all leading up to a full going-through of our baggage is humiliating and frightening. We are citizens returning to our own country. Someone should tell the Cardiff security this."
We recently used this airport for the first time in 25 years (moved back to Cardiff). Parking was close enough to the terminal to walk and was incredibly cheap. Check-in was no different from any other airport I have ever used and security is no worse either (always a trial anywhere). Prices at the bar and cafe were shocking (more expensive than Heathrow) but you don't have to buy. On our return we were off the plane and in the car within 20 minutes and that was after collecting bags which is pretty good in my experience. Other reviews moan about charges for Pick-up and Drop-off but most UK airports now do this and there is a free area if you wish to use it. It's a shame that there are not more flights but this might cause its own problems with congestion. I desperately want to use my local airport so I hope the management does something to attract more airlines to Cardiff. Cardiff Airport has the potential to be a first class regional hub.
Flew twice this Summer from Cardiff as I live locally everything went like clockwork but unable to check in online and airport looking very run down. What must visitors to the only airport in Wales think.
This has to win the prize as the worst airport in the world. You are charged a £1 to drop off which is not even outside the terminal they have gone crazy in the name of security. You can park outside Heathrow terminals and get out of the car with bags etc and free of charge. The check in desks are abysmal and slow considering they hardly have any flights going through and the security area is painfully slow rude and inefficient. They had a nice flight to Zurich flying out of the airport the last few months and I now see that they have lost that to Bristol.
We haven't flown from Cardiff Airport for over 3 years despite it being our closest and most convenient airport as we live in west Wales - we decided to give both Cardiff and Vueling airlines a chance as we usually fly from Bristol (far more choice of flights and usually half the price). We arrived 3 hours before our flight and due to horrendous service at check-in and awful service through security check we only just got through to departures with 5 mins to go - disaster of an airport really needs to sort itself out. We will not be returning to Cardiff and we have just booked our October half term flights with Ryanair from Bristol. They seem to be ripping any remaining customers they have left off for every penny they can! As they are now charging to drop off near the airport - this is a total disgrace we have 2 young children and we need to get them out as close to airport as possible together with cases while I park at the overpriced car park - but here in Cardiff I now have to pay a pound just to drop off my wife and kids.
Since BMI baby has left this airport it has become far to expensive to use the airport from now on all our holidays will be from Bristol or Birmingham. I personally can not see this airport lasting much longer and the management are closing this airport by out pricing its use to the working class people I have just priced a return flight for September this year from Cardiff to Alicante Spain and it comes to £149.00 from Cardiff and the same flight from Bristol is £46.00.
Incredibly small airport which has it's good and bad points. No queues at check-in and security are always welcome. However major shortage in places to eat needs to be addressed. Waiting areas were clean as were the toilets - both before and after security. Ground staff were very helpful and friendly. Better advice on how to reach the city centre wouldn't go wrong however!
Avoid this ironically-named airport especially if you're not a local and especially if you're using it to arrive. If you've found and survived one of the limited flights followed by a long wait and an over-the-top interrogation at passport control (which seems to be standard for non- Europeans) then comes the punch - you're in the middle of nowhere and you won't get any help. It's hard to believe that an airport like this still exists.
I fly from this airport regularly to NCL and although it has very basic faciilities it's very quick to get through check in/security and onto the plane. I only use the coffee shop and it's always open when I pass through. Shame there is only a limited range of scheduled services from the airport though.
It's going downhill even further. The shuttle bus to the newly-built link railway station is being retired from the end of May leaving pax without a car to a disorganised bus service. And guess what? The only hand scanner for self-printed (online) checkin documents was out of order again today. Unsuspecting travellers thus had to return downstairs to the departures hall queue up at checkin lines often waiting up to 20 mins for a card boarding pass. I suggest that regular travellers send in their spare change to the Airport Manager so the Airport Appeal for a Second Scanner Fund can buy a secondhand backup reader from a more efficient airport. That said staff here are fine and often a bit frustrated at the inefficiencies from management.
Cardiff is a typical small airport which has traditionally been principally for charter flights. Over the years I have seen its custom fall away as charter customers switch to Bristol and Birmingham both of which offer far better service. Cardiff has tried to reinvent itself as an 'International class' airport but it is never going to compete with the likes of Birmingham and that has failed miserably. Because of security restrictions the roof is never open and the upper floor rarely accessible. The building has all the charm of a Communist era building with few external windows. Compared with Bristol it is very claustrophobic. The land side facilities are minimal. The only positive side is the helpful disabled facilities and support that is offered.
Cardiff Airport has strengths and weaknesses. It is small so you can easily get from one area to another without too much difficulty. It has a pleasant Executive Lounge and a small range of shops. Retrieval of baggage is fairly painless and staff are fairly friendly. However the airport is still set in the 1960's and the major re-construction work to make it a 2000's generation airport has not taken place. The limited choice of flights the supporting services of bars restaurants and car park all create the impression of an airport with limited ambition and initiative. Earlier comments about drop off and pick up remain issues to a certain extent (the logic of having a security barrier at which you are simply waved through without any check seems a particularly useless feature).
Semi derelict dirty? Not sure how anyone could describe the airport as this - unless they have some sort of an agenda. I use the airport 3 or 4 times a year and find it perfectly acceptable for what I need. Not perfect but then again what airport is? Last week after flying from Edinburgh I disembarked paid for the car parking (not pre-booked) and was out of the airport within 15 mins. What is the problem with that?
Have used Cardiff airport a few times but only due to flight price rather use Bristol even at a higher cost. Staff are friendly but the airport is semi-derelict dirty and the building work never seems to finish and the benefits cannot be seen. Car parking is expensive and the shuttle bus almost non-existant even access by road is difficult. Do'nt believe their claims about being accessible by train.
I've never really had much problem when flying out of/into Cardiff. The security system needs looking at - passengers standing in queues for over an hour in high season - I witnessed a lady passing out as a result of standing in a non airconditioned room for over an hour. There is only one taxi rank outside the airport but there are local firms that you can ring for a taxi. £27 to Cardiff city (as a previous writer stated) is actually a good price - Cardiff Airport is actually around 12 miles away from the outskirts of the City. I agree that the airport needs to up its standards dramatically to compete as an international airport but it is getting better.
Had the misfortune of using Cardiff last week! Arrived early for a check in at 6pm and had a couple of drinks in landside bar imagine our surprise when at 4pm we were told that the bar is closing and that the only bar facility was Airside! We were unable to go airside as check- in for our flight was not till 6pm. We then went to restaurant landside to get a hot meal - the airport closes landside it would appear at 4pm even for food! Once again the response was go Airside! Cardiff airport claim to be an international airport - act like one and have a full service available landside.
Travelled out and back the same day to Dublin on Aer Arann. Getting dropped off at the airport requires running the gauntlet of the security staff on the approach road - twice we had to stop and tell them we needed to drive to the airport to drop-off. Security seems a bit over the top - especially as they merely waved us on - didn't check the car ask to see my ticket etc... Checked in on-line so avoided the queues - amazed how many security staff are employed. Arrival back later that evening was very different. The airport is no longer allowing cars to pick-up from outside the terminal - instead cars now have to enter the unlit short stay car park down the road from the terminal building and wait for passengers to find them. Not so easy when its dark and raining. After leaving a very chaotic terminal building I had a difficult time trying to find my lift home. The car park being used is unpaved with mud and gravel underfoot - not sure how anyone would manage with a luggage trolley. It requires a walk along the airport road for a couple of hundred yards. Once I had found my lift (could only do this by means of a mobile phone and directions) it took about 10 minutes to exit the car park as cars were not following any type of one way system - reason - no arrows painted on the gravel. I have no idea what the management of this airport are doing here - the airport is a disgrace to Wales (and the UK for that matter) and I would be ashamed of welcoming any visitor into Wales via this airport.
Really worn and shabby but it is small and one can get through quickly which is definitely good but not a great advertisement for the capital of Wales. There is a lot of room for improvement. It compares poorly to Bristol which is pretty average. The road system between the airport and the city is like something out of another era. This airport really is a bit of throw back in all senses and this a for a city with the millenium stadium.
I have never found getting to the airport a problem. The road access is fine - much better than Bristol. However the passport control system on arrival back into Cardiff is a nightmare - the only airport I have known to take so long is Plodiv in Bulgaria!
It's tatty when compared to the likes of Bristol International Airport both in terms of number of destinations you can fly to as well as overall look and feel and the food options are low quality and over priced. On the plus side it's easy to get to by car but public transport options are severely limited and it's a nightmare if you are reliant on a taxi and your flight arrives at the same time as a load of others (expect big queues!) Definitely not a place with the customer at it's heart.
Can't understand the fuss with poor road access. Cardiff is much easier to get to than most UK airports. I regularly fly KLM to Schiphol then to Shanghai. CIA is shabby and run-down catering facilities very mediocre but fortunately I don't need to use them as I drive my own car and find I can get from the place very easily. I have never encountered traffic problems. I understand taxi and public transport provision is poor.
Have flown from Cardiff airport several times in the past 12 years. Little has changed however - the airport is in dire need of a complete make-over. Not the cleanest of places decor old and overall looks more like a bus station. Going through customs coming from an Amsterdam flight also can seem a little nerve-wrecking - many folks are pulled over and usually customs officers with sniffer dogs come over to you I assume sniffing for drugs. This can be a little intimidating with a dog sniffing all over your luggage and person! Outside there is only one taxi company and they can charge 27 pounds sterling for a trip to downtown Cardiff. In contrast if you take a taxi from Cardiff to the airport with another taxi company it will be considerably less! One final note - recently it took me 40 minutes in the morning to get through security leaving Cardiff! In summary although this can be a useful airport to link with Schiphol in Amsterdam in reality it is way below standard and I'm surprised Welsh Tourism and local business do not push for better standards and service. Bristol airport is much nicer!
"Didn't personally fly from Cardiff but we took my daughter and a friend there as they were going on a day's educational visit to Auschwitz. Access was well signposted and the separation of ""drop- offs"" and ""pick-ups"" seemed to work quite well. We were pleasantly surprised at being able to drop off the girls right outside the terminal building without any fuss. Picking them up late at night was less straightforward as they seemed to take ages coming through to the Arrivals area after the plane had landed even though none on their flight had hold luggage to collect. The delay was at passport control as three flights arrived within about 20 minutes of each other. By the time the girls came through the queue for car parking payment at one end of the arrivals area virtually joined the queue at the other end for the (one?) ticket validating machine. Some people obviously got fed up waiting in one or other of these queues so there was a snarl up by the exits from the car park while people left their cars to pay at the ""box"" nearby and others with tickets ready (but time running out) fuming because the exits were blocked. More pay / validation points are needed. As to the airport itself my daughter (used to Liverpool & Manchester) described it as ""sweet""!"
"When will this minor provincial airport realise it should have aspirations? As previous posts show public transport is poor especially late and early in the day. And it must be one of the few European airports that does not have a taxi rank and where very long waits in a tiny taxi shed are common. The interior is dreary and the up down turn round down up of the maze-like entrance from incoming flights is hardly an 'international arrival' experience. I use it because it is close to home but every journey brings another example of lack of customer focus and management grip. The other morning I was travelling with light hand luggage only and had printed-off my boarding card from the web. Thus I went straight upstairs to security. ""The scanner's not working you'll have to go back downstairs to check in and get a regular boarding card"". That I did queuing up patiently. Then upstairs again where a different member of staff remarked ""sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't"". I asked if she could get a supervisor to put up a prominent notice at the foot of the stairs when their only scanner went out of order like this - just so that pax didn't have to go up the stairs only to have to go down again and then up again. This appeared to be a revolutionary idea for Cardiff. Perhaps they can't source a notice board and marker pen - and I'm sure they haven't thought of having two scanners have they? They certainly haven't trained their staff to be resourceful and pro-active."
We flew into Cardiff airport on Thursday 24th April intending to get public transport to central Cardiff. We missed the two buses that could have got us there (one direct and one via a rail connection) as they left the stand within a couple of minutes of each other and then we had to wait an hour for the next to arrive although one was scheduled to have arrived after about 45 minutes it did turn up but having dropped passengers off it drove away without picking up the waiting passengers. This was at 5pm so hardly an off-peak period!! We returned to the airport on Monday 28th April to fly to Malaga. It took us an hour to check in with bmibaby although there were only about a dozen people in the queue ahead of us. When we got to the desk we were a kilo overweight so we removed a bag of magazines from our suitcase and put it in our cabin bag which was almost empty. This put us below 20 kilos but the girl did not seem too happy at what we had done and insisted that we put the cabin bag in a measuring cradle even though it was a regulation size airline cabin bag. It fitted easily needless to say. Was she resentful at not being able to charge us excess baggage? We have travelled dozens of times all over the world with that bag and never been asked to prove its measurements before. Then it was the turn of the security check into departures. One desk open a large queue of people and further delays. We and others expressed our annoyance at the fact that there were 11 other security staff just hanging about chatting to each other. To add further insult to passengers some 'staff' who had been waiting to clear security were called forward and given priority over paying customers! The general facilities of the airport seem good but clearly there is a major management problem which causes problems for passengers and probably results in loss of revenue for airport shops/cafes etc. as passengers spend so much time in queues they have little time left for anything else.
Strict minimum no much to do no much space. If you can prefer Avianca vip lounge with snacks drinks and wifi.
I did a recent domestic round trip through this airport. Arrival is uncomplicated (no jetways and a short walk to the terminal) although travelers should be aware that the luggage trolleys are only for the use of porters unlike other airports. Taxis await outside the baggage claim. Check-in is more complicated. The first departure area one encounters is actually where ticketed passengers go to reach their gate. The actual check- in is further down the walkway - no signs are provided but employees are quite helpful. The airport appears to be in a state of protracted renovation that is evident at departure - a regular visitor commented that it was different every time he visited there so conditions may change. The security is pretty simple - no removing of watches etc. The gate area is a bullpen and the monitors provide the names of airlines but no departure information. There is a cafe and a small gift shop but little else nearby. Free wifi is provided. Departure announcements are not translated into English or any other language although a large proportion of travelers obviously were foreigners
The airport has undergone refurbishment in recent years and is pleasant and air-conditioned. Security is tight and efficient. One problem is the availability of refreshments. There is only one major cafeteria - located in the walkway between the domestic and international sections of the airport - but it is a rip-off. If you buy something simple like a soda and a chocolate bar though the courtyard by the domestic arrivals area is very pleasant. When you clear customs upon arriving you need to go to the little taxi services window just outside domestic arrivals to request a taxi to go into town. The attendant will then give you a ticket with the fare printed on it depending on where you go. Do not go straight to the taxi rank nearby as the drivers will attempt to harass you into their cab smile a lot and then rip you off! Alternatively if you don't mind a short 2 minute walk you can just walk straight down the street that leads out of the terminal and get a taxi (or even a local bus) much more cheaply.
Two small entrance doors only for the Terminal 2 therefore long waiting lines. Security check failed in the entrance. Easy identification at the airport. Poorly maintained and dirty WC. Very limited equipment. Average boarding areas. I already tried the main lounge which was not bad but there wasn't a wide enough choice of food. I don't really recommend this airport only for a stopover.
A good experience at Casablanca: it'll never win any awards but my experience was generally positive. I was through immigration in about 15 minutes my bags came in another 10 and I was on a train to Marrakech shortly after. Departure was even better: a quick and smooth check in and then through immigration and security in 15 minutes. The weak point is the overpriced food court in the basement of T2. I expect to be ripped off at airports once they've got you airside but the prices at Casablanca were pretty ridiculous. That said the overall experience was positive.
Worst airport I've ever been to. It took 1.5 hrs to get through immigration. Officers were wandering around aimlessly talking to one another talking on their cell phones congregating in groups with no interest in helping anybody or doing anything while the lines got longer and longer as more flights arrived. A riot almost broke out the crowd was so unruly. The time it took to get the passport stamped averaged about 5-7 minutes per person. One poor family from the Congo talked to an officer for about 30 minutes at one of the windows and was finally told they had to go off to a room somewhere to talk to someone else.
I fly in and out of CMN once or twice a year and on the whole find it to be ok. There is lots of time waiting for passports to be stamped as each person has to have an immigration number added to their passport. Your bags may seem to take ages to come but a little tip will start them coming through surprisingly quickly. One tip is to get you immigration card filled in before landing as this will delay you otherwise on arrivals or departures. Make sure you have credit on your phone as the airport phones never seem to work. Be careful what you say in your own language in front of some of the officials as they can understand a lot more than you think.
Beyond the precincts of this airport is an appealing and welcoming country but passing through CMN is a stressful experience. The facilities look frayed at the edges but are at least functioning but the impression is of an airport that is staffed as part of a job creation exercise with motivation energy and charm being in short supply. Security is a particular bane with backed-up lines and staff relishing the chance to exercise their power by barking at pax. My most recent experience was in transit from a flight that originated in Agadir. All transit passengers having already endured security checks at the point of origin were subject to fresh checks despite tight connections for many. I am in no rush to return.
Excellent on arrival clean efficient immigration system utter chaos on leaving avoid this airport.
Utter chaos all baggage seemed to be dumped on one carousal. Queues abound a place to be avoided if at all possible. Nightmares about going there again.
Transit via CMN on the way to New York. Airport made a good impression because of the convenient terminal good air conditioning caring staff English speaking security. There were plenty of seats in the secure zone but all of them were separated by handrails to prevent passengers from sleeping on them. Nice duty free shops. A pity many shops were closed at night during our layover. I can recommend this airport.
It is difficult to understand how a nation interested in tourism could tolerate such a dysfunctional facility as their primary air gateway. We arrived on a domestic flight from Ouarzazate for a transfer to a Lufthansa connection to DCA via Frankfurt. After finding our way with little or no signage to the transfer desk we found one person working there who pointed us to the other end of the counter for Lufthansa. As we had just over one hour for our transfer we became concerned when no one had showed up to man the desk for more than 30 minutes. No one could or would answer any questions. After an hour a Lufthansa agent arrived and told us that the flight schedule had been changed to one hour later and after many minutes managed to issue a boarding pass. We then proceeded to security where a surly attendant looked at my boarding pass and passport and asked why our passports had not been stamped in Ouarzazate. He then pointed to a desk nearby. Of course there was no one at the desk. Finally the only really pleasant person in the entire airport arrived and processed our passports though rather than stamping the boarding pass for the Casablanca to Frankfurt flight he stamped the one for Frankfurt to Washington. After finally making our way through security we arrived at the gate where there was no arrival/departure board and no one around to answer questions. The only place open for food had sandwiches that looked as if they had been there for several days. We had to wait for Lufthansa to give us something on the plane (in our respective middle seats several rows apart). Not surprisingly when we finally arrived at Washington our luggage was nowhere to be found. Lufthansa got it to us three days later. If you have any option do not fly through Casablanca.
This is Morocco's largest and main airport but it is horrible. We arrived from Dubai on Emirates after a 9 hour flight. Immigration lines were about an hour long even though they had several wickets open. Then they randomly screened only half the luggage. There are few stores once you get out into the arrivals hallway. Just a bunch of taxi bullying you into using them. The rail station is downstairs with few signs it is dark and dingy. Trains run every hour and people just abandon their luggage carts in the walkway by the train doors so it becomes an obstacle course to get on and off. No staff collect the carts. When we arrived by train to fly out it was just as bad. They security-screen your luggage as you enter the airport but don't seem to care if you set the metal detector off. We arrived 5 hours in advance. Most PA announcements are in French and Moroccan Arabic very few in English. The check-in opened 3 hours in advance of the flight and we got through Immigration and Customs easily enough. However the departure lounge is horrible. Over priced duty free shops and an overpriced Internet cafe ($10 per hour). There are no lounge chairs. All chairs have arms so you can not lie down across open seats. When our Lufthansa flight was boarding they funnelled everyone out into the gateway outside and then stopped us. Avoid at all costs!
Casablanca airport provided a very average experience. The young girls managing the check-in counters were more concerned about chatting with each other instead of checking peoples luggage in! So it took forever to check-in. It didn't get better at immigration where the locals pushed forward and tried to skip in line if they could get away with it. And again the staff took their time with checking people. The safety check was an absolute joke! Yes it was the usual as in all other airports but here the staff didn't care about people setting off the metal detector! The airport was clean and had an average amount of shops.
"Casablanca must surely rank among the most tourist hostile airports anywhere. My wife and I arrived by Air France from CDG at 3pm and were stuck in the immigration line for 2 hours. There were a number of women with small children in the line and they too had to cool their heels until an immigration official eventually got round to processing them and eventually us. We had a driver waiting to take us to Marrakech and I feared that he might have given up. But no. Apparently this is the norm. The imigration check was somewhat ""speedy."" We got through in only 1 and a half hours. If Morocco is interested in increasing its tourist potential this is not the way to go."
"Probably the worst experience of my life. Not exaggerating. Cigarette buts and stray cats everywhere. ""No smoking"" signs and announcements yet every single individual in the [overpriced] cafe was smoking. No accountability among employees. Spent twenty hours in the airport trying to get on a flight that I had booked. Got bounced between six different desks for hours. Seventeen-hour delays flagrant lies insults and employees and police continuously attempting to extract bribes. The shops will sell you phone cards too but all of the phones are out of order. Most of the ""complimentary"" WCs are half out-of-order and lacking TP. Half of the airport (T3 and the corridor toward it) are unlit unused and poorly laid out. Employees will claim to speak English and French. They don't know English and some of them hardly know French."
"Casablanca is a terrible airport both in tems of facilities and personnel. Despite being an intercontinental airport there is bag deposit facility and no hotel. The closest one is over 3km away. The person at the information desk in the new terminal barely speaks any other language than arabic and is uninformed. When I asked the hotel phone number he didn't even have it written somewhere and had to struggle to remember it by heart! The worst is passport control: when I asked the guy to stamp a used page since I have very few empty ones for my visas he nodded and then stamped a virgin page straight away! I could not believe it! He just said: ""sorry it doesn't matter anyway""."
"SWhile the new Terminal 2 is spacious clean and well equipped check in-staff are not well trained. I came to the airport and they told me I should have had a hard copy ticket not an electronic ticket and there was nothing they could do about it. I insisted they try and resolve the problem. After waiting until all passengers were checked in I asked again for help. The girl begrudgingly said she'd go to the Main Office and took a French woman passenger with her with a similar problem but told me wait there. They were gone almost an hour and I asked for help from the remaining check in desk woman on duty. She told me she had nothing to do with ""my problem"" so my husband explained in Arabic and asked her politely for help. She was very rude and very angry I asked her for her name. She started screaming at me ""Are you the police? Are you a gendarme? I don't have to tell my name or badge number to anyone but the police."" She refused to call her supervisor and continued her contemptuous and rude treatment towards me yelling at me to go sit down. The police showed up and she calmed down. The other woman then arrived with the French woman she'd helped who also had only an electronic ticket but told me the same thing again ""We will put you on the plane to Lisbon and when you get there get your baggage and go find US Airways and ask them to straighten it out."" The police then escorted me to the plane which was late taking off which had inconvenienced all passengers. And all this problem because they claimed the computer systems don't communicate with Lisbon/US Airways. These employees need better training in customer service or they will run everyone off eventually."
"So crowded you couldn't move and the 3 or 4 kiosks for food packed and staffed by one or two people serving up overpriced and lackluster sandwiches mostly. There are no gate numbers on your boarding pass - I was told by an airport employee and a police officer I should go to gate 26 for my connection to Montreal. Then 1/2 hour before my boarding time a bus pulled up and the police yelled out ""New York"" - I just happened to ask him about my flight to Montreal and he told me to get on the aforementioned bus. This took me to the correct gate for my flight. None of this info is posted announced told to you or on your boarding pass. Only by the grace of God and the good will of surly airport staff will you get to your flight! Avoid if you can."
"Quiet clean and organized airport. The check-in is usually done quickly without waiting. Only negative point is the customs staff that always try to get some extra money out of you by asking you to be ""nice"" to them. I always told them that I already spent my last MAD and maybe could help them out next time. These people should better controlled as they put a very negative image on the country."
The airport had seen some good and tangible improvements. The problem that needs to be urgently addressed still is transport to and from CMN especially after 2330. This is an airport and many international flights arrive at or around 2300. So please CMN operators don't leave arriving passengers at the mercy of the highly priced and notoriously disorganised taxi drivers. The rating of any airport is measured not only by new buildings and check-in counters but by other services it provides to the public such transport links their availibility and their affordability.
A good effort to facilitate passengers and advance tourist industry but efforts occasionally are not enough. Nobody knows what and where endless bureaucracy and delays in everything. Big surprise: on the way back to Athens August 25th 2008 departure 02:45 we had to do the check in with only 2 desks open for 250 passengers while the man on the desk was disappearing every 2 minutes or 3 to talk with colleagues and fool around. The flight was delayed because most of the passengers had not done the check in although been there 3 hours before. No duty free shop was open for travellers to spend their money. Overall impression: decent infrastructure average to law quality services.
Casablanca Airport is a huge surprise. I had expected something less fanciful only to meet a well run and neat airport. Clearing customs in a large bright room lit by natural sunlight is comforting. It is a little darker at baggage claim and the arrival hall is more sombre than the departure. There are some money changers and unfortunately along came the touts as well. The train station is right below the airport and train service is 1 train per hour into the city (30-40 mins). The International Departure Hall on the other hand is modern bright and spiffy and again clearing customs is a breeze. My only grouse - the check-in rows and customs are far apart so a fair bit of walking is involved. The gates are clearly marked and easy to get to and eateries and cafes are fairly easily located.
Reasonable airport seemed efficient clean and friendly. Arrived in the evening and had to wait over an hour for the last train to Casablanca- Voyageurs which was annoying and there was no early train which arrived in time for my return flight early in the morning so I was forced to spent the night in the airport! Plenty of guards made the place seem secure found a couple of soft mats on which I managed to get some rest. All procedures were smooth check-in passport control and boarding by bus.
Although Royal Air Morac tries to make CMN appear as one the up to date modern connecting hubs it isn't quite there. With one 767 coming in from JFK it took more than an hour to get the whole group of passengers through. And when making a connection on the way out the waiting area isn't really up to date either. The airport is not non smoking and if you don't like to be swarmed by second hand smoke it makes it tough. The food choices again arent really up to good modern standards. But with hat said those are really the only negatives I can think of at CMN. Its got cool duty free shopping.
In transit between flights from Bamako to Lyon and return. Overall a cosey airport fairly clean and with comfortable seats. Many nice duty free shops with plenty of local handicraft and jewelry. On the minus side: most shops close at night and half the public 'Maroc Telecom' telephone booths don't work properly.
Having arrived at Casablanca from Montreal in the early hours I was wanting coffee. I had no local currency and neither did the cafe have change. I was treated to not one but two free cups of excellent espresso. This doesn't happen very often in this world we live in. This is an airport that practices humanity.
"Filthy chaotic poorly managed and miserable. Expected to queue at check-in/bag drop and that was only for 5 minutes but the queue for security had to be seen to be believed and made even worse by ignorant people trying to jump in the queue claiming they only had five minutes (but were then seen the other side drinking). It was then bedlam at the departure gate with two flights ""queuing"" at adjacent gates and incoherent announcements. Such an appalling end to a beautiful holiday. Airports should be clean there should be soap toilet paper and regular emptying of bins in toilets and proper organisation at security and departure gates all of which was sorely lacking at Catania."
Have just come back from our first holiday in Sicily - arriving and departing from Catania. Arrived at Catania Airport this morning with 2 hours prior to departure time to be greeted with complete and utter chaos caused by overflow in the airport check in security queues. Average queue time of over 2.5 hours to get through airport security - queues of over 300 deep! People missing their flights and lots of friction between passengers due to queue jumping and lack of staff in managing the situation. We only managed to catch our flight as we stumbled across an alternative queue reserved for solo passengers. Situation not acceptable nor sustainable and the airport management seriously need to address this issue. Security staff looked incredibly weary and I would have concerns as to whether this affected their ability to perform the necessary security checks.
We travelled during the busiest holiday period in August and this airport was completely inadequate and ill equipped to deal with it. There was no crowd management with long and disorganised queues at check in and security. People were pushing in and weaving in and out all the time. It was so bad that other passengers used their phones to film people cutting in the queues as evidence. There should have been more staff on duty and more desks open to deal with the crowds. Hardly ideal after a 2 and a half hour coach journey from the hotel. Also not enough toilets and very few meal options in the departure lounge plus not enough seating at our gate.
On arrival and departure I used the toilets they were the worst that I have ever used in any airport. There was no soap in dispensers. Looking at the general condition of these toilets and wash areas they looked as if they had never been adequately cleaned. A total disgrace. Management should be ashamed.
Totally under resourced. Bar and catering airside very poor. About 5 tables to eat at! VIP lounge poor as noted elsewhere poorly air conditioned few drinks and poor food. Airlines should not support it! Travelling with British Airways.
Quite the worst organised airport it has ever been my misfortune to visit. Only 2 security gates open at busy time and queues backing through the doors. No information and staff denying there is any problem. Little better after security cleared with poor experience at the gate. All in all - dreadful!
What a dreadful place. Light and airy airport but shocking facilities and the VIP lounge is incredibly bad and nothing but a terrible rip off for those who have paid to upgrade. The VIP lounge is tiny the day I visited there was a surly girl on the desk making a private phone call who seemed most annoyed that I requested the Wi-fi password which then didn't work. A few packet of crisps and a tall glass fridge with three bottles of water and a handful of bottles of orange juice. That isn't what people pay VIP fees for. No alcohol and no food and two day old newspapers. The toilets in the VIP lounge were filthy and the toilet roll holder in the ladies isn't even next to the toilet. Someone had also been smoking in the loo. The bars and shops in the airport are incredibly expensive. You can't wait to get out of this place. Once you go through passport control there aren't enough seats for passengers waiting to board so people sit on the floors.
Spacious with lots of seats. Shops are of standard number and quality. The VIP lounge upstairs is clean and tidy. Small but with good view of the apron but the drinks selection is limited to soft drinks and no food other than some miserable crisps. 2 newspapers and a magazine and that was it.
New terminal is a nice spacious building with plenty of check-in desks and several security gates the queuing times are very low. Unfortunately there are no adequate seating facilities toilets are usually almost clean but not so easy to get to there are only a few shops and places to buy food that open quite late in the morning. Staff is not so friendly and speaks only Italian. Once passport control was closed and we had to wait a few moments for the policeman to open. Never had problems with the luggage though.
Have had the misfortune to visit this airport on several occasions and have to agree with other comments regarding the filthy state of the place lack of customer service and very limited options for purchasing a meal. Last night we travelled from Catania to Malta and as usual it was filthy dirty the check-in staff surly and the icing on the cake was that the runway was closed for 3 and a half hours (no reason given for this) we has to sit and wait for 5 interminable hours with everything closed - no shops or bars to break the monotony- really not what you expect at all.
New terminal same old problems: I was looking forward to arrive and depart from the newly opened airport terminal. It looks impressive from the outside but once you are inside it is dirty and badly maintained. Arrived on Swiss from Zurich. Even as we were the only flight at that moment baggage handlers needed over 45 minutes to get all the luggage out of on the carousel. Flight was early which led to the fact that no one was available to operate the passenger bridge. Had to wait on the plane for approximately 10 minutes. Long walk over to the rental-car-offices along the old terminal where beggars and strolling dogs have taken over. Departure - overcrowded departure area. Windows and public toilets dirty. Staff unfriendly and uninterested. The only thing that really worked was the air-conditioning in the building. Overpriced cafés and bars. Catania airport hasn't improved a bit it is still filthy overcrowded and chaotic.
As Sicily's busiest airport CTA was recently given a totally new terminal building: light airy and pleasant. The building itself is where the positives end. The facility is hopelessly inadequate. There are good dining options upstairs and they can be reached by an escalator at the very far south end of the terminal that is is you can make your way past the thronging check-in queues. Looking for the toilet? Back downstairs you go and through a labyrinthine corridor and you will find them but if they are not closed for cleaning they will be reduced to an unusable state. Once you make it past the interminable queue for the security check be sure to keep an eye on the one central FID. Announcements regarding delays or gate changes (for those flights lucky enough to be parked at a gate) simply do not exist. Seating and toilet facilities airside are extremely limited and you will almost certainly have to take a bus to your aircraft on a stand-off bay. If you are arriving be in no hurry to get to the baggage carousel
If you want a nice building with service in the dark ages Catania is for you. Went to get a coffee - closed for 10 minutes while they mopped the floor you could have been served over the counter in the area not being mopped but clearly that option didn't occur to the staff. Decided to use the toilet - closed for 10 minutes while they cleaned the floor - so walked to the other end of the airport. Went to go through passport control - closed for 10 minutes (make that 30 but 10 minutes is Sicilian for a delay of indeterminate length) the reason being the departure lounge is only big enough for the passengers of one aircraft so they only let that many through passport control at once. Still not much point in getting to the departure lounge too early as there are minimal facilities that side anyway (toilet small duty free shop only good for non eec flights and a vending machine)
"Used this airport 7 times in the last 3 years. Its a little dingy as a first impression. Its small and not enough seats and the seats available are metal and hard. The carpet needs replacing urgently. There are a couple of overpriced shops for gifts and food but nothing special. The route through from plane to outside is usually very quick and much less stressful than Manila. Departure tax was php550 and it was too much. I believe the amount has now increased substantially. At the end of this form it asks""would you recommend this Airport?"" Of course, there is no other!"
"Cebu Mactan is one of the better airports I have used. The staff are pleasant in all situations that may arise and extremely helpful. I see derogatory comments on here about the cleanliness Cebu airport from English travelers, they should look at their own airports first before commenting, most airports in UK are filthy especially Heathrow. Cebu is one of the most pleasant travel experiences you could wish for after a long haul flight, or of course the beginning of one. I would agree there are a lack of restaurants but this is a comparatively small international airport that is gradually growing. "
"An excellent experience, with alighting from the aircraft through immigration, collecting my bag and proceeding through customs to a taxi outside taking less than 15 minutes. The only downside is that relatives and friends are made to wait outside in what can be hot and (in the rainy season) humid conditions, rather than the airconditioned terminal. A contract has been awarded for a new international terminal so whether that construction adversely affects the existing terminals remains to be seen. Overall a great experience: if only Melbourne and Sydney in Australia were like this! Consider using Cebu for international arrivals and departures instead of Manila if at all possible with flight schedules."
Once again I arrived at the airport amazingly I love the fact that getting off the plane and picking up my luggage took approximately 10 minutes. Immigration is the same picking up the luggage is the same nothing has changed the sad thing is my partner has to wait outside the airport and isn't allow inside the airport. As I have mentioned before it is excellent to arrive. Now departures is an entirely different matter you have to go through two security checks pay the departure tax which I think is pretty disgusting especially since they have increased it from PHP550 to PHP750 and the Cathay Pacific Lounge is pretty awful with extremely limited food and drinks and very dated. The duty free shops is expensive there is only one souvenir shop with some sort of food (admittedly I have never eaten there) a small smoking bar the washroom facilities are pretty basic too. The departure lounge itself is extremely basic hard uncomfortable seats. I been told it is now in private hands yes I noticed some lick of paints and small constructions going on but not impress at all. I am really looking forward to the new Bohol airport opening soon as I spend most of my time in Bohol.
I have been using cebu airport over many years as I travel from Cebu to Dumaguete City by way of land/ferry. It used to be chaotic in the old days but steadily and surely its getting better I went through the airport Dec 2014 Jan 2015 coming in is good no big crowds and it does not take long to get to the baggage pick up and main entrance (for those of you that get ripped off by taxis the fare to Cebu city center is P200). But the outward flight I was surprised at the check in area a few new shops a coffee shop which is welcomed and a few new souvenir type shops but still very limited for food. Have a meal before you get there! Staff are very good the porters for a small tip will do everything for you push your luggage and get you in the check out line - they are a great help and always cheerful. In short if you can avoid Manila do so as Manila airport is the worst. While Cebu is so quiet after a long haul flight and outside the taxi service and approach is managed well. If you are used to the Philippines you know how to be patient if you are new to it just show up and do not get agitated and keep smiling.
This Airport is supposed to be in the hands of a private company after they won a bidding to take it over but you would hardly think so as there are only cosmetic changes like a bit of paint and posters. I flew out of this airport recently and you have the same chaos at the x-ray machines just to get into the check-in area. There is even less seating than before in this area before you check in and you see people all over sitting on the floor waiting for the check-in counter to open. After check-in you have another x-ray machine with staff who really couldn't care. All the seating is still the same cold uninviting metal chairs. The toilets are still filthy and no maintenance on the one I visited. Its a small airport but this private operator is definitely not up to the mark in terms of making it a pleasant experience for passengers. The food stalls etc.. are very expensive for what you get so gave that a miss. The only saving grace was the free Wi-Fi that actually worked along with this airport being better than NAIA T1.
As usual entering Cebu Airport is brilliant as it only took me less than 10 minutes from leaving Cathay Pacific to leaving the airport. However I made a mistake I was approached by a taxi driver and I ended up paying double the fare nobody warned me about this. Lounge at Cebu airport is OK but could be improved. Some changes seem to be happening it seem cleaner however the departure lounge is pretty awful. This time I am rewarding it a 7 5 as it is excellent in leaving the airport but this time I have rewarded an extra 2 point on leaving as I met a wonderful immigration officer and chatted about Cebu Airport. Next year they are set to improve the departure and extra shops and reckon it will be finish in 4 years.
Both the domestic and international sections are adequate overall. I've been through this airport 8 times in the past year and it is generally a stress-free experience. It is clean the queues are usually not bad the security / customs / immigration / airline officials are polite and the air conditioning just about right for everyone (judging by the lack of people either fanning themselves or shivering). There are quite a few shops but they mostly sell the same things and travellers shouldn't rely on them for books magazines or puzzles. The smoking area in the check in area is fine but the one in the departure area is best avoided unless you're really desperate. There doesn't seem to be free wi-fi (or if there is it isn't working).
I have written several reviews. It is a brilliant airport to use when you arrive particularly if you are a premium traveller. From the moment I landed and got through immigration and picked up my luggage it took 6 minutes (admittedly with the assistant of the fabulous Cathay Pacific staff who led me through to the immigration first). The only issue I have is my poor friend has to wait outside the building. On my return to Cebu after checking in very quickly and paying my departure tax of 550 peso (honestly where does the money go) and through to the Cathay Pacific VIP lounge not bad but no hot breakfast something they should consider though. Then through to departure waiting lounge luckily the wait was only 10 minutes but plastic seats. There is talk of a new airport with 5 star facilities but I been told it wont be ready until 2030. I given it a 5 as it is excellent in entering Cebu but no points in leaving as lack of facilities.
Traveled from SIN and arrived at around 4am and had a connecting flight to Boracay 3 hours later - nowhere to sit useless wifi mosquitoes everywhere. One of my worst connections ever. The only good thing was the painless and quick passport check but that's it. Departure Quick security process and passport check the only thing I didn't like was the exit tax. Where is the tax money going? Definitely not to improve the airport.
I arrived from London via Hong Kong and as I was flying business class the whole procedure from getting off the plane luggage and passport control took less than 15 minutes very impressive however I hated the idea that people who wish to meet their friends or families at airport including mine were made to wait outside the airport in all kind of weather to me that is like treating them like 2nd class citizen. Apart from that I love arriving at Cebu as I know I be out so quickly.
Pleasantly surprised by the business lounge which is quite good for such a small and behind the time airport. However I do have several criticisms. 1: Why do I have to pay for departure tax as far as I am aware it only the Philippines that does this and I am not convinced that the money will go to improve the airport. 2: Lack of shops. 3: I would have thought there would be a better seats for business class and first class passenger again the departure terminal looks tired and unclean and the seats are not that comfortable either.
Cebu International Airport has changed a lot and for the better. It's small and efficient. Exiting the airport is smoother and hadn't been hassled anymore by airport staff asking for freebies and asserting to help with your luggage even if you don't want to mainly to ask for tips. It's quick and smoother so well done.
I arrived at Cebu airport to leave for HKG and then onto London. (My last report was 3 weeks earlier on arrival this one is departing). The main part of the airport was buzzing and a nice selection of shops however once checking in I was so surprise that I had to pay departure tax and had no pesos on me luckily I had English money but I suspect I got rip off with the lousy exchange rates. Why on earth do I have to pay this departure tax wasn't happy about this at all. There is one restaurant at the departure lounge and it is very expensive had to sit in the large waiting area where the seats was dirty and very uncomfortable 3 hours of boredom no cheap drinks either.
This is the first report of me arriving in Cebu after a long flight from London to Hong Kong I was very please to get off the plane and find my luggage was already waiting and straight to passport and out all in 20 minutes however a little surprise how quite the airport was but had not realise that my friends were waiting for me outside the airport.
The international departures terminal does not have much to offer some snack shops money change souvenirs and a restaurant none if which accept credit cards. The seats are not very comfortable. If you have to kill between flights I'd recommend going across the road to the Waterfront Hotel. From the front of the international departures building cross the road and walk up the stairs where you see the sign for the There is a restaurant in the lobby which is a more comfortable place to wait they accept credit card and provide access to free wifi.
Small airport with very expensive duty free shops that only accepts USD. Not worth it to shop in there at all when you know you are obviously paying a premium. A lot of taxi touts once you step out of the airport. Airport is old and run down with nothing to shop in there. No cosmetics or alcohol duty free shops. Worst thing is that you have to pay an airport fee of PHP550. This is the only airport which I've been made to pay an airport fee for goodness knows what. There is also no wifi in this airport.
For a rather small but busy airport it's efficiently run. Friendly staff too expensive so called tax free shops extremely expensive to drink a beer after check in and security. More convenient then NAIA. Could use an upgrade but there seem to be plans to build a new import in nearby Cordova. Knowing how things go in Philippines this will probably be in 2025. Better to pay 550 pesos airport tax in Cebu then 750 pesos in Manila.
Departures is the saddest and most horrible airport I have ever used. The lower bar has been re-set in my estimate. You have to pay PHP550 each 'extra tax' regardless of what you already paid in the ticket. Only one little duty free which I thought was overpriced there is a small store selling a few snacks one restaurant where they make it clear that they do not accept credit cards. Most people walk out when they see the prices. After much tinkering I did manage to get the free wifi working. Quite a shock after visiting such a lovely country.
Arrived on an evening flight from Manila that was delayed. All good on arrival luggage and disembarking quick. International departure was good. A little crowded as a couple of flights were leaving but through to check-in quickly. Staff at the Cathay desk were friendly and helpful. No long queues. Aerobridges always help as does a 747 with 3 seats to myself!
Look like the airport is stuck in the 1980s. Too brown and too dark the ambience is not appropriate for a city known for its beaches and clear skies. Fairly clean halls but the toilets need a little more scrubbing. Very few dining options. An upgrade or a new terminal must be in order.
The airport is small so it's easy to navigate. Used the domestic area of the airport and it was a good experience. Check-In hall was old but very clean and spacious. Security was okay we had to pay the terminal fee as usual. Departure gates were rather spacious and cozy. The best part was the free internet and the computer stations! It was fast and I was able to go on facebook and check my emails. There were an ample amount of restaurants and shops and the staff was rather friendly. I much prefer Cebu than Manila it's small manageable and the experience is less stressful.
Used Mactan-Cebu International Airport Sept 2nd 2010 close to 12 midday (incoming) and Sept 22 2010 and again around 12 midday (outgoing). Small yes but I liked that. Very few shops. After check in and passing customs and all that it was no problem of leaving airport building to smoke a ciggy. Plus be aware you have to pay PHP 550 on departure (airport tax?). What struck me most as odd that upon arrival there was no soul in arrivals. I've learned that in case you have no plane ticket you can not enter airport building. So those who will pick you up are outside the airport building waiting for you. On both occasions I did not experience any hassles.
This is a nice small airport and arrival and departure managed in a breeze. Arrival with luggage through immigration and my greeting party in about 20 minutes from an international flight. Leaving is a bit more problematic as you check in and then come back through security but it works ok and staff are very friendly and helpful albeit it will cost you a tip.
Used it 14 times within the last year twice internationally. The smallness of it is nice you are quick everywhere - international arrival/departure was swifter and nicer than Manila NAIA. Few shops. After check-in you can leave the terminal again to wait outside or in the restaurants.
Decent for a smaller airport. After trying to navigate through larger airports for years I have learned to appreciate smallness in an airport. True not much selection for shopping but I don't go to an airport to shop. I really love the fact that its easy to get from one part of the terminal to the other. Once you clear customs you are right on the street where you can easily hail a taxi to take you into town. I have always had a soft spot in my heart for this place.
Cebu Airport is Okay as an airport but really very very small and gets very boring let alone the stuff you want to buy that are at least 10 times more expensive than in the city. I had to wait for 3 hours before boarding my flight to Manila we had to change our gate 2 times and it was the most boring time in my life.
First time experience at Cebu. We arrived by boat at 6am and went straight to the airport as we didnt have the funds to go roaming around we on our voyage home. It was disappointing we were not able to check in our bags and the atmosphere was like a deserted town everything just about closed. Seating uncomfortable also. Once check in opened for our flight it was a breeze going through. The next trip I had the best customer service I could get. Due to traffic we had arrived as the plane was boarding. They accepted me on the flight rushed my bags to the plane and rushed me through immigration. This would happen for a second time on next departure. Once again we was rushed to the plane and we departed for Malaysia. This displays great commitment to not leave anyone behind. Facilities of the airport are a little bit disappointing. There are no chain food restaurants at the airport and not much available after you have passed immigration. I would give 5 stars for the customer service but its let down by the actual airport. An upgrade is needed for potential expansion as I would prefer flying into Cebu rather than Manila as Cebu is peaceful and calm at the airport all it needs is an update.
Cebu is a more convenient and less hassled entry point to the Philippines than Manila. Taxi travel to and from Cebu's CBD is efficient aided by the two bridges in lieu of the former one connecting Mactan and Cebu islands. Provided one arrives on an airline like SilkAir that flies at off-peak times to Cebu immigration queues can be non-existent. However leaving can be a different story with a 20 minute queue to obtain entry to the checkin area and then a 25 minute wait in the mid afternoon through immigration. Cebu's beautiful resorts are popular with Koreans so make sure that the departure time of your flight does not coincide with flights to Seoul or Pusan - you will not be able to get to your gate in five minutes. The restricted entry to checkin is designed to stop hordes of well wishes from clogging checkin but it does add a delay not found in many other non- Filipino airports. There is a limited range of shops once through immigration and they do not stock basics like 'load' for a local cellphone - so come prepared with snacks if need be. It is possible once you have checked in to hand in your boarding pass and re-enter the 'outside world' but you do have to then queue to go through security to the checkin area so some may conclude it is not worth the hassle to bid a final goodbye to family friends or business associates.
Mactan airport is very okay but relatively small with less than 10 gates and looks like it has seen better days. Since Cebu tourism is booming at times the airport is overcrowded. No place to shop and eat apart from the souvenir shops and cheap donuts. Immigration was fast though and people are nice. The airport seems very laid back though which is good. Definitely better than Manila airport. Tip: on arrival go to the departure areas for a cab because the arrival coupon taxis are way more expensive.
This Airport especially late at night at the international departures is now overloaded with passengers taking flights that the queues have become horrendous both at the first security check before you get to the check in. The it takes 45 mins now just to clear immigration & another 15-20mins to go through another security check before you reach your gate. Now plans are in place to expand the international terminal & at this time of night its like a zoo. Don't bother buying from the Duty Free as the prices are sky high & you could have bought these cheaper in town.
Totally agree with Dirk Visser. Really bad airport very dirty. Absolutely nothing to do after immigration (no shops very limited seats) so don't pass immigration too early. Only one shop with extremely limited selection. Don't plan to buy anything there you must be self sufficient until you get on the plane (bring your Ipod and your own water/food). Very surprising that the airport is still so sub- standard although so many tourists are going to Cebu (which is beautiful by the way). A pity. Might be better than Manila (haven't been to Manila in 4 years) but that does not say much.
We flew into and out of Cebu-Mactan Airport in November of this year. We arrived quite late from HKG and had to wait quite a while for immigration to process our full flight together with a PAL flight from Japan. Luggage claim area was like stepping back in time....a bit dodgy but ok. Leave the terminal and you are literally bombarded left and right by taxi drivers and money exchangers. Leaving was a different story. The check-in desks for the international departures are behind doors that are kept locked until a few hours before departure which means you are sitting in a rather dingy terminal until your airline is ready to check you in. Security is a joke but that didn't surprise us after being in the Philippines. Once you check in you have the option of going through to the gate or back into the main terminal. We were told to go to immigration and were surprised with the fact that we had to pay an airport tax P 550 or $ 11. Once through passport control you are at the gates. There is ONE store: Phlilippes Duty Free (total rip- off and joke) and two cafeterias which were asking ridiculous amounts for everything on the menu. As the gate area was kept closed you wait in a huge area behind passport control just behind passport control. We had a laugh as we stood (there were only 5 chairs) behind the passport control people who were playing video games on their computers. That explains why they snarled at us when we arrived! We interrupted them!!!! Other than stand and wait you can be massaged by ladies that await you when you clear immigration who bother you even when you barely look in their direction. So for those travelling to this prison- turned-airport do not clear immigration too early as there is nothing to do! Facilities are way under par but being the Philippines it shouldn't come as a surprise.
"Mactan-Cebu International Airport (CEB) is a much better entry point to the Philippines than Ninoy Aquino (unless your final destination is Manila of course). However despite the fact that Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines there is nothing overly impressive about its airport. I arrived at CEB on a domestic flight and was quite surprised how desolate the terminal was. This was in stark contrast to what was waiting just outside. For a flight of 60 or so people it seemed like the whole city of Cebu was waiting to greet us in the ""welcoming area"". I stuck out like a sore thumb being the only Cacuasian around but never once felt threatened by the smiling faces of Filipinos. I was immediately greeted by a sonata of sales pitches as taxi reps competed for my business. I gently waved them off since I was waiting to meet my friend. They were persistent but not obnoxious. The availability of transportation is not a problem at CEB but you will need to learn the art of negotiation to avoid being charged unfairly. Thankfully my friend is quite skilled in these matters and we never had to pay an elevated fare. A few weeks later I left from the international terminal at CEB for a flight to HKG. I don't remember much about my actual impressions of this terminal since I was contemplating a heartbreaking goodbye to my friend. However I do remember that the security line was not long at all and the entire process of getting my boarding pass and clearing customs took about 15 minutes max. The airport workers were quite friendly except of course for the customs official. CEB is a utilitarian airport and nothing more. It helps you get around the Philippines and S.E. Asia but luxurious it is not. It does however have a much more friendly feel than NAIA and Manila's domestic terminal."
This is a small international airport. The approach to the terminal is not very impressive. The food selection and stores outside the security check area have very few selections compared to other international airports of comparable size. Security check line is short and the process efficient. Once inside the terminal is bereft of quality food outlets. There are few stores that sell souvenirs and indigenous food items to take home. We stayed inside Philippine Airlines business class lounge so we avoided the large crowd outside. The public restrooms are not well maintained. To get inside the boarding area each passenger must pay an airport departure tax payable in cash. The boarding area is too small for the Airbus A330-300 that PAL uses for its Cebu-Manila flights.
Airport of Cebu is very laid back style. But it makes me feel more convenient than to go Manila airport. There are 4 international airlines to choose from - Cathay Silk Air Malaysia Airlines and Qatar airways. Its hassle free airport and when it comes to transportation lots of taxi outside the airport. And two big hotel near the airport - Waterfront Mactan hotel and Days hotel.
"I have never expected that a small-scale airport can be able to provide outstanding and extensive services to travellers. The airport was very clean and tidy, and everything in the terminal was well organised. Incredibly large number of facilities including an observation public bath. A wide choice of restaurants was available and the prices were reasonable. The sky deck was very large and great for phototaking. Airport signs were very clear and staff were always eager to help travellers. Convenient access to the city centre. The airport gave us a great impression upon our first visit to Nagoya."
Connected through this airport with Delta. It seems slightly older and smaller than Narita. Passing through security was quick and painless. The place is clean and has an open and bright feeling. There are standard airport shopping opportunities if you are interested. The meal options seemed severely limited which would be my only real complaint however I believe it is a large complaint because airplane food is awful.
Good small airport for a short transit. Not as big as NRT which makes it not as daunting. Small shopping selection but pretty good food. Efficient staff and quick security measures makes transit quite painless.
I used Nagoya as a transit airport between Indonesia and USA. Quick arrival procedures. Everything was well signed in Japanese and English. Transfer desk was unmanned but I bypassed as I already had boarding pass for connecting flight. Security was fast and polite. Terminal was clean and orderly. My flight was delayed by 10 hours. Terminal has high ceilings and big windows looking out over ramp providing an open feeling. Clean restrooms. Only 1 restaurant which only takes Japanese Yen and a Starbucks but there are several money exchange booths. I did not find an ATM anywhere. Lots of duty-free and high-end shops but only one very poorly stocked news stand. Free Internet throughout airport both via wifi and several laptop stations with Ethernet power plugs chair and light. Lots of vending machines throughout but only take Yen.
We flew into Nagoya Airport with the intent of catching the bullet train to Tokyo. Definitely need more english signs in the transportation areas. We went on the train into Nagoya first went to the front nice and plenty of seats lots of smokers though
Nagoya Airport is an impressive building with a nice selection of shops and restaurants. However be prepared for excessive immigration queues fairly rude check-in staff and exceptionally brusque (indifferent at best) customs officers. Perhaps I just passed through on 2 occasions when everyone was having a bad day! Just don't expect much from the staff!
If you have the benefit of arriving there you'll be pleased with the smooth flow of passport control and customs. Plenty of staff on hand to assist even some volunteers to help you when you come out of customs if you don't speak much Japanese. The local impeccable train network is a 5 min walk from customs where you can connect right into Nagoya city within 30minutes. Departing out of Centrair the fourth floor is full of interesting places to shop and eat. So much space in the airport it's spotless. Skydeck is a treat and favorite is the sento (Japanese public bath) right up there on the fourth floor.
I have been though the new Nagoya Airport a handful of times which took over from the old and tired Komaki airport. Overall it is much better than the old airport being clean and relatively spacious. There is a small food court with a limited selection of food (western and Japanese) as well as high brand stores. Staff are very polite and my experience through customs and immigration has been excellent. We did sometimes have to wait a while but we were treated very well by staff which is a highlight of customer service in Japan. The airport has frequent connections (every 15 mins) to Nagoya city via the dedicated Meitetsu airport train which is wonderful. Cost (one way) for the Limited Express (25 mins) is 1100 yen / $11 and the Express (35 mins) is 830 yen / $8. You have both premium cars and standard cars I would go for the premium since there are less people and the interior is very nice but the standard is fine though often crowded. A decent airport.
Nagoya Centrair (Chubu) has one fantastic characteristic that we almost never ever see anymore today: a great open-air rooftop deck allowing for great views on the tarmac and runways. The airport building itself is pleasant and has many food courts before security but only a handful of (very expensive) shops and one disappointing restaurant beyond security. The departure gates area is very clean and relaxing but boring except for the big windows to watch planes and enjoy the view of the bay . It takes about 45min (and 110 USD) by taxi from the airport to downtown Nagoya.
The new Centrair airport is a vast improvement on the old Komaki airport which had all the charm of a bus-stop. However it's newness seems to be the only thing it has over the previous airport. It's design is almost exactly the same as Komaki's. The check-in and arrival areas are not that much bigger than Komaki's except there is a small shopping area and foodcourt upstairs. The shops in this area tend to be mostly high-end brand name vendors and the foodcourt is so small you can hardly ever get a seat there. In fact seating seems to be an issue in centrair. In the check-in area also there really aren't that many places to sit down and wait. This is different when you proceed through passport control and enter the departure area. It's huge and spacious. A lot of room here which is nice but it's also very empty. There are very few places to get food drinks or duty-free shopping. I had the over-all impression that perhaps the departure area of centrair is a bit too big. I was there during the christmas/new-year period yet there were hardly any flights leaving. Overall centrair is a good clean and spacious(on the departure side) airport. No problems with check-in arrival and baggage claim. It still feels a bit utilitarian though. Despite being new it's only a slight improvement. After using Komaki several times I was looking forward to a new and improved Nagoya airport. Centrair is an improvement but not much of one I'm afraid. I've never used Kansai yet but all the airports I've used in Japan to date tend to be no more than a place to check-in and simply just wait for your flight. Nothing more nothing less. Centrair is no different really. In the future I'll stick to Narita as it 's a similar distance for me to travel to.
Centrair is an amazing airport and far better than the old Nagoya airport. The airport's access to downtown is very efficient and convenient but lacks enough foreign language staff to help foreigners in need. Centrair's top floor is divided into a Japanese and Western areas. the Japanese side sells local foods and products. The Western side has a wide variety of restaurants ranging from French to Korean. Shops range from last minute to luxury. One of its great options is a Japanese Hot Spring bath - but the wait time is close to 1.5 hours. The departure area is very clean and relaxing but lacks small shops or cafes for getting that last minute thing. The DFS is all luxury goods and lacks local products. Luckily it has nice big windows to watch planes come and go and enjoy the view of the bay. The departure area has multiple internet connection tables but require users to be members of certain providers. Several locations are wireless and free for everyone. Transfering between International and Domestic is a simple walk after going through customs. Chubu International Airport is a great place and in my opinion better than Narita for convenience to a downtown area and better than Kansai for ease of use and shopping. This airport is a destination all its own.
"Current Nagoya Airport is just clean. That's all. All of facilities shops and staffs are filled with so many problems. I am Japanese so it's no problem. But as for passengers from outside countries it is big PROBLEM and big HEADACHE. The first when you get off the airplane immigration tests your patience. (almost every ""foreigner"" looks like complaint obviously) they immigration staffs speak worse English with grumpy face. The second when you go out of airport for transportation Far less English signs are waiting for you. Mentioning to departure in the common area there are few food shops and shopping stores - bad and expensive. Besides All goods of them is for Japanese. According to the government and Nagoya local government Next year 2005 they will complete to architect ""New Nagoya Airport (We call 'New Chubu Int'l Airport') "" at the seashore in Tokoname town. To be physically far from the Nagoya center - it is no doubt. Probably as the same as Narita and Kansai new airport will put facilities food shops and immigration staffs who speak worse English. This is the very nightmare. Awful. Terrible."
A terrible airport. Nowhere near enough facilities staff or processes to cope with the peak demand. An awful experience which ruined the holiday. Snow on runway caused major delays and backed up flights in UK - in the Alps? In the winter? Why should this have been a surprise? Limited snow clearing equipment. This airport should not be allowed to operate as a tourist airport for high volume of ski flights. Staff flustered passengers under pressure and tempers flaring. A horrible horrible experience but one for which there is little alternative choice with Crystal Ski to the Mont Blanc area. Unfortunately - same airport destination already booked for next year (prior to this horrific experience). 4.5 hours in slow moving road traffic to arrive at airport for 10 hour delay with what seemed like thousands and thousands of other similarly angry people. Read many reviews since which all give similar warnings over a long period of time - what do we have to say differently to prompt some dignified changes to this facility's operation? Avoid if you can.
This is by far the worst airport experience I have ever had. I have travelled extensively to some pretty remote places but this one is by far the worst. 1 hour queue to check in with no more than 10 parties in front of us. When we got there he had no record of our ski equipment been booked for carriage though I showed him the document which plainly showed it had so he had to call his supervisor. The check in itself was makeshift with half a dozen tee shirt clad youths throwing bags onto trolleys once finally checked in. Then another queue for security. Few trays to put things in when you got to the departure area (4 gates) it was completely full. I suspect there were at least a thousand people in a room designed for 200. When we arrived we had to circle for 30 minutes as there was no where to put us. There are tent like structures all around the terminal building serving as arrival security baggage halls etc. the main issue seems to be greed in that they are taking far more flights than the airport can handle. Avoid at all costs.
Chambery Airport is a disgrace! Every flight in and out delayed by 1 hour. Very limited seating very poor services (1 restaurant and snack bar). The departure lounge is just one big room (with 4 so called departure gates) where all different flight passengers just stand around mixed in hoping to be near their gate - utter chaos. Avoid using Chambery Airport at all cost - go somewhere different and if skiing in La Plagne/Les Arc area use Geneva airport. This airport just cannot cope with more than a few planes a day!
A total disaster which spoiled the holiday. Wildly over congested seating very limited and passengers sleeping all over the floor. Flight information on two screens only horrific queues for check in and immigration. Avoid at all costs and the extra transfer time from Grenoble Geneva etc more than makes up for the horrible experience that is Chambery.
Terribly congested airport especially ski resort changeover delays. Always delays as only limited capacity for airliners in landing parking weight restrictions etc. Cant find seats no room to sit on floors litter everywhere toilets overflowing with urine no proper information and facilities unable to cope. A usual Saturday experience according to our Crystal rep. This airport is a health and safety disaster. Travel companies should put pressure on Chambery authorities to expand and improve facilities. Until then use elsewhere - Grenoble Lyons or Geneva or try other countries as it is a horrible experience.
Extremely congested during the arrival and departure of weekend ski flights. Neither the arrivals area nor the departures area are physically big enough to cater for the number of customers trying to get through. Very subject to weather delays: day before we arrived most flights were diverted to Grenoble. We were processed (!) efficiently in both directions and will probably use the airport again due to the shorter transfer times to resorts than from GVA or LYS.
Small airport at the base of the French Alps catering mainly for British skiing flights during the winter season. Facilities very limited
CZX is a small domestic airport (however a new big terminal is being constructed nearby) with basic facilities (and no milk at a coffee shop). Efficient check-in although boarding is little disorganized as you have to walk to the airplane. Not much to do apart from couple of souvenir and grocery/travel stuff stores airside
The worst airport I have ever experienced. We arrived two hours before our flight which we assumed would be ample time but alarm bells began to ring when we saw massive queues everywhere both outside and inside the terminal. When we found the check in desk although the queue was not that long the check in person took a ridiculous amount of time to deal with each party so it took ages to reach the front of the queue. We then discovered that we had to join another queue to have the bags x- rayed! After that we queued again to get through security and this was a free for all with no system at all and the staff again were really slow and didn't seem to care at all. By the time we finally reached the gate the whole process had taken over one and a half hours! Had we arrived at the airport much later we easily could have missed our flight altogether! The airport clearly neither has the staff nor the capacity to deal with the amount of traffic it receives and is a shambles more akin to airports of the 1960's. This experience means we are very unlikely to ever visit Crete again and this is a shame as the island has much to offer. Since the island is very much tourist dependent the authorities need to get a grip on this problem as it is a disgrace.
"Arriving from Amsterdam the baggage arrived quickly. Very long queues even outside waiting to depart interfering with arriving passengers. Departing from Chania: We arrived in good time to avoid this. We appreciated the nice air-conditioning in the departure hall and lounge after a long hot car journey. The toilets are in need of an overhaul broken seats WC roll holders tiles etc. You have to carry you hold luggage from check-in to security. Before security a big bottle of water costs 50 c After security in the bar 1.50 Euro. The monitors with information all worked. The holding bar was adequate. ""Tax-free"" shop and bar expensive. This airport is better than Heraklion airport when we were there last year."
Nice small airport for winter chaotic during summer. Long waiting for baggage screening. Not many stores expensive bar toilets below standards limited signage far from city without extensive bus routes. Arrival area very dark light bulbs burned out airport information desk clueless. Needs improvements very fast.
"My wife and I were attending an Army reunion at Madison WI. Trip to Madison was good, but on the return flight into Charlotte the requested mobile transport for my wife was not at the gate and approximately 30 minutes were wasted trying to procure transport to get to the gate by boarding time. The driver explained that his cart broke down and that he checked 3 others which were not serviceable. We had to change to another cart as they cannot change floors. On the lower level, the employee scanned in the wrong flight and gate and my wife caught it before we left, very poor management on having serviceable transport available as well as employee who can operate a scanner. The connecting flight from Charlotte to Columbia (CAE) is not worth the effort with far too much time wasted on the ground, boarding, taxiing and deplaning and no space on the small ""puddle jumper"" aircraft for standard carry on luggage. Next time we use the Columbia shuttle service."
"Distance from car rental area to check-in isn´t that far compared to other US airports. TSA is a story of it´s own. Not the airport administrations fault! Be prepared to walk a few minutes to get to your gate, but it helps to burn some calories. I rate it as one of the best in the eastern US."
"Where to even start. So they installed machines in the arrival area, presumably to get arriving US citizens through immigration faster. Or so you would think. Instead, they actually added those machines as an additional step to hassle incoming passengers, because after queuing for half an hour for the machines you will then be made to queue again to see an agent. If you have the misfortune to be a permanent resident in this country, they will now take your fingerprints and your photo twice. Yes, both at the machines and at the officer's. Of course they then also ask you what you want in the USA. The whole process is ridiculously inefficient, the staff are unfriendly and unhelpful, both visitors and citizens/residents of this country are treated like criminals. The worst experience at any airport."
I have to go to this airport every time I need to fly somewhere and it's such a hassle. The staff and employees are very unfriendly and unhelpful and they assist people with the fewest words possible. Most staff don't look like they enjoy their jobs. Checking in is especially a hassle. They don't care if you miss your flight or not. The airport itself isn't too clean either. The signs are sometimes confusing as well.
What a nice airport. Can get international flights but not huge and crazy like DC or Atlanta. Lots of facilities and they have old fashioned rocking chairs in the terminal area-nice touch. Also have attendants in the restrooms-also a nice touch. Only negative is their intercom system. Hard to tell which gate desk the announcements are from and hard to hear some clearly.
The airport is very busy and does a very good job moving travelers. But the U.S. Customs Service is the very worst of several ports of entry we have been thru. The staff are not well informed uniformly rude and insulting. Overall an extremely poor impression for foreign visitors.
CLT-their directional parking signage is directionless! They should be ashamed of themselves! Had a 7 am flight to SFO and circled your airport three times following your LT parking signs only to find no parking lots. If I had an airport facility saturated in construction chaos I would have employees out in the open to direct traffic and answer questions. If anyone is thinking about flying out of CLT during the upcoming holidays my advice is don't!
Charlotte is a busy airport - a hub for US Airways - and TSA lines there can be tough. There are - when all areas are open - five TSA lines so check out other lines if the middle ones are full. Once inside the airport has pretty good amenities - massage and decent fast food. US Air club is very nice one of the best in the USA. Outside there is a lot of construction. The Hertz rental car center is atrocious - very long lines in May. Attendants in men's room is a lost occupation but does exist here. Stopping off at the men's room is usually a nightmare in most airports. Full time attendant makes it much cleaner. Overall this very busy airport has more southern charm than say Atlanta Hartsfield. For those renting cars the local highways are atrociously under- signed. Often there is one sign and when you look around for more guidance there's nothing. Charlotte NC and NCDOT need to do a much better job in adding signs: Those of us renting cars are new to the area and we will get lost. Most major cities do a far better job of communicating the airport's location with adequate signs.
This review is strictly about customs and immigration. They turned what used to be a simple process into the biggest cluster I have ever seen. First you enter a cavernous room at one end. Then you queue up at the other end. You go through multiple twists and turns with hundreds of others until you reach a kiosk. A person barks at you when the next kiosk is available. Then you are left on your own to figure out the purpose of the kiosk. Once you follow a series of instructions it takes your picture. Then you have to redo the steps for each person in your group. Lastly your are funnelled into another queue to meet with a customs agent to stamp your passport. Once out of line you pick up your bags recheck them go through security again and hope you make your connection on time. This entire process from stepping on US soil to going through security again took around 50 minutes. And this was a Monday night. Ridiculous.
I arrived to Charlotte Airport on my connection to Atlanta. Aircraft had to wait about 20 minutes on the taxiway before going to the gate. Airport was very congested and not maintained. People were standing everywhere and gate change was done last minute. Terminal and gates were very unorganized. Everyone at the gate wanted to charge their phone but plugs were very limited and some were not working.
Going through Customs in Charlotte was horrible. Long lines. Very few employees. One employee in particular was rude and obnoxious. I have been through Customs many other places including London a week ago...all were a breeze to get through. Charlotte also used to be easy. What has happened?
Living in Philadelphia I always feel annoyed that I have to change flights at CLT to get to almost anywhere in Latin America on US Airways. That said it's very convenient if your flight arrives at concourse D (a number of PHL-CLT flights arrive at concourse D as they continue on to international destinations) as all international flights depart from concourse D and it's very convenient. If your flight arrives at any other concourse expect a really long walk. However my latest arrival at CLT was anything but convenient. There's a lot of construction going on in the customs and immigration area and confusion reigns with even the staff not really understanding where anything is. The Global Entry kiosks are still right at the entrance to the hall but for some inexplicable reason instead of letting Global Entry passengers exit through the lane closest to the kiosks they are now directed to join the huge line of passengers waiting for the other lanes and then directed all the way to the other side of the hall where the exit for Global Entry is covered in black plastic. After pointlessly waiting over half an hour to exit the scene in the baggage claim and customs area was just as chaotic. After finally emerging from customs and directly into the baggage re-check-in area I totally forgot that I needed to check in the two bottles of wine I had purchased in duty free before I rechecked my suitcase. Luckily I hadn't got too far but by the time I returned to the counter my suitcase had already disappeared into the bowels of the airport so I then needed to check in my carry on bag with my wine. What an absolute mess of an airport.
Not a half-bad airport definitely the superior US Airways hub in comparison to Philadelphia. It's very clean nicely signed everywhere and the workers generally have good attitudes. However it would seem the runway layout may have some issues and when it was raining yesterday everything fell through by a bit. A shuttle would be good as well. Overall I'd fly again but I'd give myself more time in case something goes wrong since they aren't as quick to fix errors like some other airports I've been to.
We recently flew from Charlotte NC to Chicago IL on June 7 2013. I had never flown before but my husband had on several occasions so he knew what to do. The screening process only took a matter of minutes. We did end up having to wait for quite a while because there was bad weather outside causing our plane to arrive late. We didn't have any problems with the staff or with the facilities. Anything we needed was readily available.
I flew through CLT many times in the past and never really had anything positive or negative to say about it. However a recent experience helped to define my opinion of the airport. I flew US from PUJ to MIA via CLT which meant clearing immigration and customs in CLT. I must say that CLT is the most efficient airport I've ever seen in my life of traveling and I've traveled to some of the largest and most reputable airports in the world. From disembarking to claiming luggage immigration customs and going through security it was all literally a matter of 20 minutes give or take. I'd like to see any airport in the United States come anywhere close to that. Customs and immigration officers for international arrivals were friendly and cheerful. TSA were also surprisingly very polite and helpful too. Shopping and food choices are unbelievable not even JFK has such a selection. If ever I have to connect planes anywhere in the United States CLT is my #1 choice!
Ok airport however the parking situation is a mess. Can take up to an hour to get either long and short term lots.
Worst TSA in the Nation - security line 57 minutes long - no consideration foot the fact they make dozens of people miss their flights - over 100 first class passenger skipped the line during that time with no thought to the coach folks who missed their flights as a result.
Charlotte is a brilliant airport for arriving international passengers. Polite immigration officers simple customs formalities in-line baggage recheck and virtually no line for TSA to get back airside. And there is an excellent wine tasting bar with good food in the terminal.
Smaller and more compact than other airports we've used for international-domestic connections. Immigration and customs processes were quick. Needed a new belt and got one in a store that was open early just as we re-entered the terminal area for our connection. Only clubs are US Airways clubs which do not have showers but which are large. Gate areas can be very crowded for some flights.
Possibly the loveliest airport I have been to in my last 12 months of travelling around the world! Unfortunately I had to wait 5 hours for a connecting flight but felt fortunate enough to be in Charlotte Douglas doing so. The staff were all extremely courteous helpful and friendly
Quite possibly the worst travel experience ever. 4 security lines only 1 open because of TSA staffing issues. US Air rep gave me the wrong ticket causing me to miss my flight. None of the gate destination boards were working so they all had the wrong city names on them. I will definitely fly around Charlotte in the future. By the way when did they start allowing pan handling in the airport restrooms? I don't want to feel obligated to tip a uniformed personnel for getting me a paper towel to dry my hands.
I got through the immigration line in less than 10 minutes! Yes you have to claim your luggage and then recheck it but it was hassle free. Now the line to go through security was ridiculously long but it moved relatively fast. Overall I was very pleased with this airport.
I flew into Charlotte airport from Rome and had a layover in Charlotte on the way to Greensboro NC. First the International flight procedures were really confusing. You have pick up your checked luggage carry about 10 feet and recheck it. Very pointless. Also I've never been treated so poorly in any airport in my life. They rudely yell commands at you. They are very unorganized and blame it on the customers. I had my passport thrown back in my face at passport control/customs. Overall I was very disappointed with my experience.
If you are booking an International Flight don't even consider going through Charlotte. They do not have enough employees to handle the volume of people. We landed there from the Cayman Islands. The line for immigration was over 90 minutes. We had to run to our connecting flight. Arrived in Milwaukee missing a bag that was left in Charlotte.
Decent airport. No big complaints other than as usual inadequate space in front of the terminals for the large number of cars that drop off passengers. There should also be monitors showing flight status that are visible from the food court areas. A dearth of airline clubs - just US Airways I believe - but there are at least three of those. I found the signs giving directions within the terminals a bit confusing.
For the most part CLT is a pretty run-of-the-mill domestic hub airport. However there are two things that really stand out. The first is the good selection of locally themed restaurants. The second are the rocking chairs under shade trees in the main terminal area complete with power ports (the free WiFi is an added bonus - if only they had more of the rocking chairs because finding an open one can be difficult). You definitely get the feeling of being home in North Carolina while transiting through the airport.
The sound system is terrible. The airport needs to seriously rethink the acoustics in the terminal as messages from gates are too loud and can be heard from gates away. The sound engineering needs a lot of work.
Transiting from London and to Washington DCA was a delight. A large number of immigration officers at their desks waiting for us to get off the plane courteous and friendly staff two people in front of me at the security check to get back into the airport. The terminal is adequate with the usual selection of shops and cafes. By far the best arrival experience I have had in the USA for decades.
Transited twice during recent trip - once on international to domestic and once domestic to international. Former went smoothly. I was worried our 2+ hr connection would be sufficient but Immigration and Customs were very quick processes and we didn't have to wait too long for our bags to arrive. On the return we were on a small plane (Dash-8) from GSP. As expected some of the larger carry-on bags were taken from us and put in the baggage hold and given tags to retrieve the bags upon landing. Upon arrival the unloading of bags on the tarmac seemed to take a long time and when a thunderstorm approached we all had to go inside. Finally the workers were allowed to get our bags and gradually put them in the terminal where we waited. The airport is quite big and can take a while to traverse with somewhat confusing signage though certainly nothing like some other airports such as ATL. Managed to find the larger of the two US Airways clubs so we were out of the crowds until it came time to board our next flight.
Transferred from a US flight to another US flight. My flight from FLL arrived at the B concourse and I had to transfer to the C concourse for my flight to LGA. It was the evening rush hour and it was very crowded. Transfer was painless with the moving walkways. The selection of restaurants and shops is excellent lots to choose from. The gate area was rather cramped and the ceilings were dilapidated as well as the windows were dirty. Overall a great airport with friendly staff not the best one but it was a good experience.
"My wife just arrived at CLT with two small children enroute to PHX from PLS. The flight was 30 mins late. Customs took 2 hrs. She missed her connection. She asked if there were any special processing lines for small children like in MIA. The response ""get into the back of the line like everyone else"". Great treatment for a 5 yr old. Everyone in the airport and US Airways were rude and unhelpful. Avoid at all costs. We will continue to fly American through MIA."
While returning to Charlotte after a nice vacation we found we had a dead battery. There is an airport service that will help you with problems such as this we told the ticket attendant she radioed the service and within a few minutes he was there to boost our battery at no charge. Thanks Charlotte Too bad more people don't know that you offer such a service.
This was our first experience with the Charlotte airport having always used JFK or Atlanta what a pleasant difference CLT offers. Clean uncrowded (on a Saturday depart and Sunday return) and all staff being very friendly. Security check was quick polite and efficient. All in all the whole experience was very civilised and we would highly recommend this airport.
There is very little to make this otherwise nondescript airport stand out except for one unique redeeming quality: the availability of free wireless internet. When I used this airport a couple of years ago to visit family I regretted not having brought my laptop.
We transited CLT twice: going from Rio to San Francisco and going from Washington DC to Rio. Going through Immigration and Customs was a snap. There were plenty of shops and restaurants but we spent out waiting time in the larger US Airways club (sure wish they had showers). We didn't see much of the airport but all in all it seemed clean modern and relatively easy to navigate (less chaotic than say Atlanta Hartsfield).
"The main building with check-in counters is easy to negotiate landside. You can hardly have the check-in counters closer to the entrance doors than here. Once airside though long walks await the traveler. Security is strange with male pax asked to remove their sweatshirts (not females though wonder why). First time this has happened to me anywhere in the world and I can understand the public support for an anti-TSA demonstration prior to Thanksgiving. More curiosity at the ""Carolina Beer Co."" restaurant where the waiter asked to see my ID after ordering a beer. When I presented my driving licence he refused this as ""it was from out of state"" and asked for my passport instead. He accepted it although it was most definitely ""out of state"". When I enquired as to what this fuss was all about I was informed that they had orders to check the age of patrons to make sure there was no underage drinking. Laudable cause indeed - but one would think they would be able to recognize the absence of any potential problem without resorting to checking IDs when a traveler is like me 50+ years old. WiFi is free at this airport."
We arrived at CLT on Saturday evening at 6:30 pm from Cancun - only four immigration officers (out of nine stations) working at a time when several hundred passengers were in line to have their passports stamped. We had a two hour layover between flights and barely made our connecting flight. If that wasn't bad enough after passing immigration retrieving our bags and going through customs then rechecking our bags - we spent another 20 minutes getting through security again. They seemed to be experimenting with the new full body scanner and the process was not working correctly having to rescan a child several times in addition to wanding him. This makes no sense whatsoever. Situations like this backed up security at a time when passengers were trying to get to their next flights. One of the security employees even announced that security is not related to immigration and customs -basically saying it wasn't the TSA fault that immigration was so slow. We certainly understand the need for these protections but they must work more efficiently. The flights are scheduled well in advance why not have sufficient officers working to handle the passengers.
I used this airport for my holidays in the USA I was transiting through Charlotte. For me the positive point is that they were no big queue for admittance in the USA making it easy. After collecting bags I just have to let them in the xray and it was finished. As I got 4 hours transit I went in the city of Charlotte which is quite nice for transiting. WHen I went back to the airport I found controls ok but I found the airport style a little bit old fashioned. Anyway it's a nice airport.
I have connected through Charlotte many times for both domestic and international flights. We are always happy to go through this airport. Immigration/Customs efficient and the one time we ended up getting in late and missing our connecting flight we were given a decent voucher for food while waiting for a later flight home to PIT. Staff are friendly and helpful and there are lots of food choices.
I dread Atlanta and avoid at all costs. Charlotte makes for a wonderful alternative and the US Airways ground staff are informative and hospitable.
I travel for a living and connect through Charlotte at least twice a month and guess I just have bad luck? I fly from Raleigh which should be a thirty minute flight max but for some reason we always get grounded due to air traffic and the flight seems to now take an hour and a half. I've had to run through this airport countless times and since there's no rapid transportation going from the A terminal to the E terminal can be hell. And once I catch my connection taking off takes forever. However the free Wi-Fi is lovely and I always appreciate airports with Chili's!
Unlike the other reviewers here we had a very bad experience that might be specific to certain days of the week at CLT and/or elsewhere. We arrived in CLT on a Saturday from Mexico and went through customs around 6 pm. At that point there were maybe 2 planes full of people ahead of us and only 6 customs officers screening people. It took well over an hour for us to get through customs. While waiting 3 additional flights arrived and were queued behind us. We heard later that it took many people over 2 hours to get through and that many missed connecting flights as a result. What makes this experience especially unfortunate is that it is really unnecessary: a TSA agent told us that this is a recurring situation on Saturday nights - which means the Dept. of Homeland Security at Charlotte could have planned ahead knowing the number of international flights coming in on weekends. Instead it appears they assigned more people to herd us and/or tell people to put away cellphones and cameras than there were US customs agents. Signage in the airport is mediocre at best requiring people to direct travelers at times. On the positive side we found the selection of restaurants to be excellent and the airport clean and modern-looking.
CLT is compact well-signed easy to navigate and most importantly-not overcrowded. Only negative- my flight waited on the tarmac for 15-20 minutes for a gate to become available (not sure whether or not this occurrs frequently). Excellent alternative to transiting through Atlanta.
"Chic and comfortable. I didn't notice any decent restaurants - all they seem to have is fast food. But if there's one major complaint I have is this: how could you call yourselves an ""international"" airport and don't have facilities dedicated for currency exchange! And don't direct me to the bank - it was closed. Driving out of the airport was a nightmare but I will allow that traffic that particular day or time may just happened to be awful. Fix those little items and CLT is one of the best airports in the country."
Arrived to CLT from Munich the immigration was so fast that I have been waiting for luggage 10 minutes. Then everything was easy and fast to get a car. For sure a good entry point for that area of the US.
Any US airport that can get a UK citizen travelling in Y class into a rental car and on the Interstate in under an hour from touchdown gets my vote. CLT was presentable and not too crowded. Immigration and all other staff were friendly with the possible exception of the Hertz desk clerk who was a bit curt. I agree with the comment about car return but computer routing to/from the West always seems to take you down Little Rock Road which is a bit of a tradesman’s entrance thus not well signed rather than the more official Interstate route. Be warned!
I agree with the other reviewers about the Charlotte airport. It's a gem once you get inside. However if you are returning with a rental car I suggest you give yourself plenty of time. The rental return signage is the worst I've seen in 20 years of air travel. I've been there 5 times and it still takes me a extra time (and a u-turn or two) to find the rental car lot (I use Hertz but they all have the same problem). If you're an airport manager or city planner for Charlotte please see what you can do to improve this one glaring defect. Oh and by the way this Hertz airport rental operation is not the smoothest either. They use one or two big shuttle buses so the wait for a pick-up can be long. On the inbound they didn't have my car ready for me although my arrival was on time (and they forgot the nav system). On the return the bus driver almost ran over me when I tried to board the bus. I'm not kidding. Happy travels.
CLT is a very nice airport with an easy-to-understand approach. It is also the airport of choice if you are supposed to be heading to any location in South Carolina like CAE (Columbia) or GSP (Greenville- Spartanburg). Taking that next leg is quite expensive so land at CLT and rent a vehicle. The parking garage is simple and very close to the main building. I'd recommend CLT as a good portcall for anyone entering the USA as their customs are efficient.
I have connected through SFO LAX EWR MIA BOS etc etc and this was my first time in North Carolina. I have to say this little gem wins hands down every time. More akin to a European hub than the hellholes of Los Angeles and Boston and especially user friendly if you have children. Plenty of shops and things for kids to look at and do and just a general feeling of Southern Friendliness Id go back anytime! Definitely doing something right!
I have only used CLT airport twice (once on arrival and once on departure to/from the US) but what an experience. Based on the other comments I may have arrived on a bad day because it took me at least 90 minutes to get through immigration! I had to run for my connecting flight but I was stopped and selected for an extra security check by personnel that was in no hurry to expedite this check and I did of course loose my connecting flight. I have never experienced anything similar to this. I have been a Star Alliance Gold member since 1998 so I do travel some. Although the time needed to get through immigration may vary I have never on my numerous visits to the US (approximately 3-5 times a year since the mid 90s) had to wait as long as at CLT. Please observe that I always try to get a seat making me one of the first out of the plane just to get a head start for immigration.
My wife and I connected through CLT on our journey from Nashville (BNA) to London Gatwick (LGW) this past December and found this airport to be far superior to Atlanta for connecting flights. Courteous people everywhere you turn along with an excellent airport layout made our journey both easy and pleasant. I can't really offer an opinion on the restaurants there but the numerous Starbucks were noted. US Airways has really made a believer out of me as far as their friendly employees and pleasant flights. I have been to London on nine previous occasions by four different carriers and US Air overall has been the best way to fly. Upon return from Gatwick into Charlotte the journey through US Customs was far quicker than Atlanta Dallas-Ft Worth Houston or Chicago O'Hare. The big difference is in the sheer volume of passengers that are processed at the larger airports that result in the long lines of tired grouchy people. Baggage transfer and the distance to departing domestic gates are well laid out and the use of moving passenger walkways makes your connection a breeze. If you don't mind going through the smaller Gatwick airport for your trip to London I don't believe that you can beat Charlotte International and US Airways.
"I have used CLT for connecting flights several times. It is a very ""pretty"" airport and at times reminds me of a smaller-scale O'Hare (due mainly to the greenhouse-like windows in certain areas). Each time I have gone it has been rather crowded but the facilities are more than adequate to handle the traffic. In addition the signage is quite prominent and the layout does not leave you scratching your head. When I arrived at CLT for the first time I had to walk a few terminals over for my connecting flight. It was quite a trek but with the aid of moving sidewalks it was just a 10-minute walk."
Just returned from Miami to London with a connection in Charlotte - found this airport to be very user-friendly with several restaurants and shops. Not too busy and bliss smoking allowed in the restaurants! Would use again.
I have connected through Charlotte many times on US Air and though it is far from my favorite airport I'll take it over Atlanta for connections any day--it tends to be far less hectic. My chief complaints with the facilities include: the lack of decent eateries (be prepared to pay $8 for a cold sandwich and drink)
We connected at Charlotte with US Air on our way from Gatwick to Orlando. Unfortunately we didn't get to chance to experience any of its facilities as immigration was staffed by 2 immigration officers which meant that it took us a ridiculous 75 minutes to clear immigration. We then ordered by the US Air reps to sprint to the gate for our connecting flight which ended up feeling like more of a marathon than a sprint. Seemed nice and clean but hey it's hard to tell when your running as fast as you can with hand luggage etc. Our recommendation is to make sure your at the front of the line when getting off your plane so you don't end up at the back of a line of over 300 people being serviced by 2 surly immigration officials.
CHA is a compact but efficient airport serving a metropolitan market of about 500000 residents. In the past it has suffered from proximity to major airports in Nashville and Atlanta but today 7 airlines service Chattanooga with a rather rapidly growing number of destinations. The airport is very clean with free Wi-Fi throughout and parking and security is superior. Low fare airlines have joined the legacy carriers so there is quite a nice selection of flights and fares. Sure saves time and headaches of leaving from larger airports.
CHA has the misfortune of being too close to Atlanta. Over half of Chattanooga flyers drive to Atlanta (or Nashville or Birmingham) to fly. However CHA offers competitive fares and I would guess most flights now are regional jet. The airport itself is beautiful with a large copper dome as the facility's trademark (in honor of the city's railroad heritage). CHA is a modern state-of-the-art airport and is where I choose to fly out of even though I live in the northern Atlanta 'burbs.
As a resident of Chattanooga I have used this airport on several occasions. With just 5 gates it seems to be a bit undersized for a city of 160000. However speaking from an architectural perspective it has more character than most airports I have flown through and is very clean besides. There is virtually no chance of getting lost owing to the small size and simple layout. The security checkpoint is neither intimidating nor cumbersome but the agents are thorough and will search your bags if needed. CHA recently added a daily direct flight to Dallas/Fort Worth and will soon follow up with direct service to Houston and Orlando. Other cities with direct service to and from CHA include: Atlanta Chicago Charlotte Washington (DC) Cincinnati and Memphis. CHA really is a connected airport and getting moreso all the time apparently.
One of the easiest domestic airports to figure out. Just a couple of restaurants but each one has great selection of food. They've been getting better flights and it is transitioning to more of a transit type airport. Staff is scarce but ticket counters are fast to check-in and the security line is real quick(5 minutes at the most). I now start my journey to any destination from here.
Arrived at Chengdu on domestic flight from Shenzhen. No problems getting to town on the bus. A dew days later I had to depart on a domestic flight to Jiuzhaigou. Beware there are two terminals both a distance from each other. I got off at the wrong terminal no sign of a transfer bus so I had walk. Not much fun in the rain.
Chengdu Terminal 2 looked new and clean. Despite Air China advice to reach airport 3 hours in advance the check in counter opened only 1.5 hours before departure. Check in immigration and security were efficient and quick. The departures waiting area had nothing of interest even for Chinese travelers let alone foreign ones. There were several shops selling the same souvenirs at inflated prices. The shop girls were standing bored as no customers even entered the shops. There was one book shop selling only Chinese books and 2 restaurants serving standard bland and tasteless fare not the renowned Sichuan cuisine again at inflated prices. The waiting area for our flight was barricaded off and pax had to sit at some other gate. Absolutely nothing for international passengers and it seemed even for Chinese. Even Domestic termini are better.
XIY-CTU-AUH. Arrived from Xi'an on domestic flight in Terminal 3 which was newly opened in Spring 2012. All very clean and tidy with clear signs in Mandarin and English. Quite a long walk to Baggage Reclaim for the furthest gates but not unreasonable. Toilets clean and plentiful with both squat and regular options. For International Departures there are 2 main dining options before Check-in either KFC or local Chinese food. There are a few stores selling various local foods and some souvenirs. Check-In pretty good and Passport Control and Security all pretty smooth. No requirement to remove belts or laptops for security scanning but do enforce the 100ml liquid rules from Europe. In the International Departures no dining opportunities but a couple of coffee-shop options along with the usual array of Duty Free shops. Most departures are from one of the 11 airbridges. Announcements made in both Chinese and English. Toilets are clean.
KUL-CTU-KUL. The Shuanglin terminal is equipped with all the usual amenities. The toilets are clean the terminal is clean. The terminal also has signs in English/Chinese. Going through customs and immigration is a breeze. You can reach the city centre easily by bus or taxi however signs to the bus outside was not to clearly shown.
This is the major airport for southwest China. Flew into Chengdu from Shenzhen where it was quite a lengthy walk from the Terminal 2 gate to baggage claim. This was topped off with a further lengthy walk to the opposite end of the terminal for the taxi rank. Flying out a week later I had time to look at the airport more closely. Terminal 1 is old and definitely looking it's age. Terminal 2 was shiny and modern with three fingers that extend out. Plenty of interesting shops to keep myself amused inside the terminal and the lounges were adequately comfortable. The feeling was light and airy inside with a good view to the outside despite the extra glass screen separating arriving passengers from departing ones.
I had the misfortune to fly home from Chennai airport just under two weeks ago. It must be the slowest airport in the world. I've been to India six times now so am well acquainted with the slowness of almost everything in the country. However one expects better of an airport especially one that's fairly new and modern-looking and no other Indian airport I've travelled flown home from has been as bad. The first queue was a long one but no longer than many other airport queues I've been in but unlike in most other airports it hardly moved the queue for immigration at Heathrow when I got home was just as long but constantly moving so didn't take too long. The Chennai queue was unbelievably slow. Then came the queues (plural) for security. I understand that they have good reason to take security seriously and I'm glad they do but they kept recalling bags to have another look at them and then someone would search them by hand. One young woman who was just in front of me had her handbag taken from her and put through three times and searched by hand twice - this really can only mean that the staff didn't do it correctly the first time unless it was the result of a malicious desire to make passengers miss their flights. My bag was put through the scanner twice and searched by hand. I saw this happening to other people too. This was on top of the body searches of course (which I know are necessary but do add more time to the process). This is without question the most inefficient airport I've ever used and I shall do my best never to have to use it again.
I have visited Chennai airport 6-7 times in last 10 years. Surprised to see that despite having world class airports so close (Bangalore and Hyderabad - I visited both and they are excellent) Chennai didn't learn any lessons. Both the International and Domestic terminals are messy. Not clean and I am sure many wouldn't like to use the rest rooms. There are not too many options in the terminal for restaurants or bars or shopping. You will always see a few people being escorted by airport employees to the immigration and for security clearance causing irritation among the people standing in queue. There is no medical assistance or pharmacy either.
Used the airport on January 8 2015 as part of my transit to Delhi. Had extended stay there as my connection missed and needless I say the experience was nice and better than what it was when I used in four years back. The new terminal is excellent  well stocked and surprisingly clean than many similar Indian Airports. The only problem encountered was the security which is still slow and tacky to negotiate.
The old airport is of a very low standard without any facilities. Toilets are not clean and smell. The newly constructed International terminal looks fine from outside. Even though airport may be small facilities and ground staff are the parameters which make an airport among one of the best.
I flew in to Chennai airport from Sydney recently along with my Australian colleague. The first impression of the new airport is still disappointing with the promised changes not being seen anywhere. With the travelators not working its a long walk to the immigration counters. I had a quick passage through the immigration whilst my Australian colleague didn't have too much luck. The Malaysian airlines stewardess didn't provide him with the immigration card. He was asked to fill it in at the immigration counter which was fine. The immigration official was insistent on exactly knowing the address of the hotel where he was going to stay. The officials tone and tenor was disappointing. This is definitely not the way for the immigration officials to conduct themselves. Overall Chennai airport is a huge disappointment.
Passed through MAA three times - once in transit one arrival and one departure. This airport should be avoided if you have any choice or option. Arrival was at 3am from LHR very long walk to old terminal for immigration although both immigration and baggage were quick and cheerful. Outside the terminal is a complete zoo. No easy public transport. Luckily we had a driver. Transit involved a 4.5 hour change from international to international flight. We were met off the flight by airline staff who did not identify themselves as such until asked then placed in quarantine in a locked area with two other transit passengers. The only facilities were a water fountain and a dirty toilet with no paper. The staff took our passports boarding passes and luggage receipts. To my relief they did come back an hour later with new boarding passes and luggage tags and let us out of the locked area. It did all work in the end - we made our connection and our bags arrived at LHR - it just wasn't very pleasant Facilities at this airport - food shopping wifi toilets and lounges - are all minimal or poor and anywhere from unclean to filthy dirty.
Chennai airport needs to address the following: Cleanliness in the terminal no tissues in the washrooms rusted pipes in the water dispensers open waste bins near the restaurants. Lot of makeshift equipment and ladders placed around. No 'wet floor' sign used when cleaning. The sign board to 'Terminals' is hidden by a Police barricade as you approach the airport from GST road. Commendable part is the immigration which is quick and to the point. Security needs to be more faster or more lanes to be added. More variety in the restaurants is needed. Long wait to travel between domestic and international terminals. I am sure the airport can be made a lot better than what it is now.
The new international terminal that looks grand from outside is badly planned inside. Construction dirt and grime are seen on all white-painted columns and girders. The lounge is located on a higher floor and is accessible only by lift. An escalator would have moved people more conveniently. Anyway the lounge is pathetic compared to the lounges in the old terminal. There is no arrival immigration in the new terminal and passengers are forced to walk some 500 m to the immigration counters in the old terminal. The smelly toilets seem to have been transplanted from the old terminal and are maintained just as filthy. One cannot help comparing this airport to the cleanly maintained private airports at Bangalore and Hyderabad. Wonder when immigration and baggage handling facilities will be available in the new terminal.
I was there a couple of months ago and was shocked to see carpets instead of tiles in the new departure lounge. Needless to say they were badly stained. Everything else was lousy I asked at the book-shop about Indian news- magazines and was snobbishly told that only foreign publications were available. The food and drink available is expensive and awful. Truly a disgusting experience.
The brand new terminal is falling apart. Tiles broken/cracking all over the place. Who was the genius that recommended fabric seats-they are very badly stained. Bathrooms smell and flood all over the place.
This airport is a dump. It's meant to be brand new. There are signs for a food court - no food court just some terrible looking lounge that you can only enter if you have a certain type of Visa card. There used to be one bar but someone in their infinite wisdom decided to shut this down without providing an alternative facility. What sort of person presides over this fiasco of a facility?. It's filthy dirty and the staff have no idea how to deal with customers. Unfortunately as with any airport one doesn't have a choice but to use it. Shame on this airport and the management of it.
Filthy (even the new international terminal) chaotic and certainly not recommended if you can avoid it. The so called business class lounge (La Meridian) is a joke and no matter how much the airlines pay to use it I assure you it is 100% too much. Food is terrible and drinks limited. If you are arriving here try to do it without checked in baggage baggage reclaim can take more than 60 minutes! On the plus side some of the staff I found helpful on the departure side. At all costs avoid.
"Cant say more about an airport that has been built only as a ""Show put up"". I travelled by an AI flight (International) from Mumbai to Chennai that was already 1 hour late. Landed at 12am in the morning only to be kept waiting for baggage that didn't come out for 30 mins. I saw a baggage security point that has been put just immediately near the downward escalator. There was a huge line of people trying to put their baggage in the security screening area but there could have been a big disaster with all the people coming down on the escalator and the crowd ahead not moving beyond the baggage screening. Luckily nothing happened. I travel often to Chennai on work. Must say that I have stopped using the Washrooms in this airport as they have become dirtier than before. The so called garden inside the airport is all dried up. The same old shops that have been moved from old terminal to the new one."
I visited Chennai a few times in the last month (Bangalore - Chennai domestic leg - Jet Airways Chennai - Pune domestic leg on GoAir Pune - Chennai domestic leg and Chennai - Delhi international Air India en route to Sydney. The new domestic airport is functional and it's good to see aerobridges being used for domestic flights. They have segregated the arrival and departure at the domestic terminal across two levels. However they still don't have the in-line baggage for the GoAir domestic flights. The biggest disappointment is the international section of the airport. The bathrooms are nothing to rave home about. The gates are still in the old terminal with a long walk to them. There is not a single good bookstore with a good collection of books. The shops try to fleece the customers with different prices for different passenger based on nationalities. This doesn't happen in New Delhi or in Hyderabad or in Bangalore. They don't give receipts for the purchase in the stores unless you ask for it.
Every time I enter this new so called 'swanky' terminal I keep looking (at regular intervals) at the roof and the glass panels just to make sure I'm not in way of something falling off. Surely this is the lousiest and dirtiest 'new' terminal built in the recent past. The end product is a big disappointment for those of us who have been waiting for a new terminal for over several years. This is not an 'international' airport to feel proud about. The funniest part of this airport is that only the check-in is in the new terminal and then you are led in a 'smelly' pathway (without AC) that connects the old airport for boarding the flight. The (striking) AAI staff neither want to keep this terminal clean nor allow private interested parties to maintain this airport - too bad. If I were to rate this airport on a scale of 1-10 I would definitely rate it at '1' just because when you look at it from a distance (from the roadside) it looks swanky especially when the lights are on at night!
"Compared to the airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad the international terminal here is a joke. Arrival is in the old smelly terminal. Once outside chaos reigns while trying to get to your pre-paid taxi. I was pleasantly surprised while departing to see a spanking new terminal. However once inside this ""new"" terminal is already looking old with dirty carpets and glass windows. The worst part was that this new terminal is just a facade. One goes down the escalator to the boarding gates and finds oneself back in the old terminal once again. This so- called gateway to South India needs a new airport privately built and managed. Definitely not recommend this airport."
Charging Rs.60-70 for vehicles dropping of passengers is outright daylight robbery. Either they should keep guards like in Mumbai or Hyderabad to ward off vehicles who park on the road or they should just increase the time at least for taxis. Every time I go to the airport I get annoyed. I don't even want to go into the toilets issue and lack of eating joints.
I don't think I have ever been to a worse airport. I don't know why they have wasted money in revamping the whole place. Just giving it a bigger structure doesn't mean renovation. All those old worthless shops are still there. Food is bad. Toilets are as bad as they were in the older airport. There's no proper bar or smoking lounge. There are no food chains. The baggage counters are a total disaster. Staff are bad. My advice: avoid using this airport if you can.
I cannot think of any airport worse than Chennai airport. There is a constant smell in the building and the biggest nightmare are the toilets which are almost always wet and unclean. The airport resembles a bus station. Add to this arrogant security personnel and semi-educated staff it amounts to the worst airport in the world. What is sad is that these un-inspired people just need to compare with Hyderabad to see how bad they are. The pain just continues when you go outside to be cheated by the auto/taxi people.
The new domestic terminal seems to be improving by the day. Ample space at the drop -off area on the departure side with separate entrances for airlines clearly marked . Couple of coffee shops outside which is welcome if you have friends / relatives seeing you off. Inside there are multiple options now in terms of coffee shops restaurants (couple of them are due to open) book -shops and other small shops. Ample seating space and the quality of announcements is also very clear. The washrooms have received a lot of bad press since the terminal opened but that seems to be improving now. Not everything can be blamed on bad maintenance here some of it is also dependent on user behavior. Also noticed that there was no regular cleaning of the trash bins and most of them were on the verge of over flowing. Something needs to be done about this. The arrival side has an easy access to the car park with a luggage ramp which is quite helpful. Only minus point is the long walk from the gates to the baggage claim area. Overall an airport which is improving by the day.
Had to use the airport to take a 5am flight reached the airport at 1.30 hoping to have some dinner before checking in. Surprisingly the airport terminals were shut! The cityside has no passenger facilities - no toilets no food outlets no phone booths and no security. For a crowd of 300 about to catch the first few flights there were just 4 security guards. Terminals opened at 3am. This 'new' airport has just two outdated X-ray machines for baggage screening. Horrible queues. Airside area is equally pathetic with horrible loos. No clarity on boarding gates as there were no announcements the screens spent an unusually long time displaying information in Tamil. Additionally the design highlight of the new terminal an in-terminal garden is hardly viewable for dust on the glass curtain walls. Charging points seemed to be inactive through the terminal and the so-called food court is yet to open. All in all the most pathetic airport I've had to use.
This airport never changes. The new terminal is less than a year old and its already showing its age. Especially the washrooms. I hate using the loos of this airport with Wet floors leaking taps and worst of all the staff don't care. This airport is definitely not at all up to the mark. The staff are particularly disinterested in managing the show! Brand new class exteriors are the only thing good to see.
Back to MAA again after 4 months. Pretty much the same as before. Long lines at the airline counter but no lines at immigration. Security was ok. Immigration staff were pleasant on both directions. One complaint I have is that there are no announcements in Tamil in this airport. None of the airlines bothered in my 2 hours waiting.
Flew into and out of the airport in December a year after my last trip. Arrival pretty much the same as before. Immigration queues are long and slow. Bags took a while to arrive and no issues with customs. Crowd management outside the airport can be better hopefully the new terminal will work better. On departure I did not have a print out of my boarding pass but the security personnel accepted the ticket on my tablet but with a warning. Immigration is long and took an hour to get through security was quick. They have moved the location of security for the better and airside is much more spacious with lots of seats. I've always found immigration personal friendly in Chennai airport and have never encountered a grumpy one. Overall standard Indian airport with not many amenities hope they open the new terminal soon.
Chennai Airport will hopefully be replaced with the new terminal in the near future honestly I found the business class really poor and very over crowded with limited choice and poor options. I did not stay long preferring to walk the terminal than sit in an area that I did not feel welcome. The terminal for departures is not particularly clean but does seem to work most staff are polite but not particularly friendly although I did not find the rude either. They do love rubber stamps though. The arrivals process was quick although immigration did seem to take longer by western standards it is not that bad for the rest of the world. Roll on the new terminal - it must be better than this.
Flew on the night AI flight from SIN to MAA and back. Overall this is an airport that gets you in and out without nothing much to do in between unlike Changi. Having said that I prefer MAA over BOM DEL CCU or BLR simply for the small size closeness to the city and the un-chaotic nature of the airport. Immigration and customs have been pretty decent. Some construction going on and can't wait to travel through the new terminal. Hopefully it will be better! Only gripe is the lateness of baggage arrival especially during nights when most international flights arrive. They need more handlers customs officers and most importantly more conveyor belts!
I recently used Chennai airport's international and domestic terminals for transit to Madurai from Sydney as well for the return trip back to Sydney. The international terminal has some improved facilities with the inline baggage scanning system reducing the time to check-in. The immigration customs and baggage arrival are quite smooth though the customs and immigration officials could be groomed a bit to be passenger- friendly. They let domestic passengers enter the terminal even if the flight is 5 hours away which is a positive. However the biggest gripe is about the toilets. The toilets are smelly unkempt and very poor both in the international as well as in the domestic terminal. The domestic terminal doesn't have enough seats which forces passengers to sit on the floor. They still use the buses to get the passengers to the aircraft on the domestic side of the terminal.
I have flown from Chennai 5 times (all international travel). I saw some expansion works in Dec 2011. Every something is being expanded but at a very slow pace. When I entered the airport the floor was not clean was not able to enter the toilets - everywhere smelt. When I complained airport staffs behaved in a very rude manner. Security checks were impressive and very strict cleared everything in 10 minutes. Immigration at departure and arrival in Chennai is always a nightmare. Immigration officers spend more than 10 minutes on each person. Hope to see improvements in the near future.
2012 and I'm not sure this airport has budged in terms of quality ratings. It's about relativity and considering the time gone by a lot of airports in India have come a long way not just gleaming glass and steel structures also aesthetics amenities cleanliness and just looking like it belongs to the right time period. Chennai airport in 2012 reminded me of Mumbai's in the 90's if you don't see the signs to the toilet your nose can rescue you.
Officials are awful security staff make the traveller uncomfortable and keep scolding passengers. Immigration process takes too long by staff with a long face but luckily they don't scold the passengers. Duty free has good options. Airport floor and washroom are extremely unclean. Not enough signs and flight information boards.
"This is a very poor airport. Toilets are disgusting. After check-in it gets even worse. A very dark and old- looking place. No signs or information of any kind. No view of the planes. Only upside is that nobody arrives early so we were quickly through security and check-in. There are no restaurants or shops. Just a very strange bookstore and a small ""cart""."
I flew in and out of Chennai last week. Traveled to Tuticorin during the week and back to Chennai to catch the international flight. I had 5 hrs before my flight was not allowed into the international area for at least 2 hrs no suggestion of where you could rest. I spoke to the security staff at the visitors viewing gallery and was let in and sat around for 2 hrs unable to use the washroom facilities as I was unable to leave my baggage unsupervised. Once International check-in was completed had to sit in the gate lounge for nearly 2 hrs. Washroom facilities were filthy toilets were filthy awash with water no soap to wash hands. Terrible experience - please clean up your act.
Chennai airport is a disaster. Visitors not allowed inside the terminal oppressive security staff everywhere whose rationale is impossible to grasp. Had to wait for several hours outside the terminal unable to re-enter the terminal after arriving on a night flight an hour ago. This airport is definitely to be avoided although I've noticed similar measures and problems in other Indian airports as well.
Flew in and out of Chennai International and domestic four times in Dec 2011 and Jan 2012. Arriving from Singapore was the worst it was a wet night and after purchasing the prepaid taxi voucher I exited the terminal to a scene from hell. Fifty or more taxis trying to load passengers in the rain. There was no proper queue arranged and it was a free for all. I last used Chennai airport in 2004 and it has just deteriorated since filthy toilets piles of rubbish swept into heaps beside overflowing rubbish bins with dirty chairs.
Things are improving although slowly. Airport terminals are becoming larger newer with more international arrival and departure flights. Passengers have to be bear the brunt queuing time at immigration and security is too much. With more flights there is no increase in immigration and security counters no priority for women children or elderly passengers. Passengers spending so much time queuing only increases anxiety of the already stressed traveler. An increase of seating and cleanliness can be improved.
Chaos is the one word which encompasses Madras airport. I think the people of this city ought to be ashamed of this gateway to this city. Filth grime poor hygiene and generally impolite staff make this an awful airport to arrive or depart through. The security staff are terrible. If you can avoid this airport then do so. I doubt if the modern new terminal is going to be any different since the staff running it will be the same.
No change since last visit. Terminals are not the most modern. Bathrooms are not very clean and food options very limited. Seating options are very less as well for there are many international flights leaving within a small window. Security was quick and as always immigration officials are pleasant and chatty. This airport is not one where you want to be stuck for long. Can't wait for the new terminals to open up.
I recently used visited MAA via Cathay Pacific from Sydney and left for Sydney on Thai. The airport still has the staid look on it though the number of immigration counters seems to have increased. The luggage took a while to arrive. On the return leg the immigration and the security were a breeze
Used Chennai airport (arrival from BKK at 23:30) and departure to BKK at 0025. Security checks on arrival and departure are very strict but well organised and going through is relatively swift taken into account the ageing building. My flights being at night both on arrival and departure I could experience on arrival a problem for locating an exchange booth which is operated by Thomas Cook but in a remote corner stall. When outside the crowd and dim lights give a feeling of unsafety. On late night departure after the process of check-in airside hall is a shame for regular travellers ie. the ones not holding a pass to use VIP rooms. Ranks of dirty seats (check before you seat down) probably never cleaned up. No facility except one small food stall selling bad veg sandwiches and few drinks at extravagant price for India. No restaurant despite a sign showing there has been one may be 2 centuries ago - toilet and drinking water also to be avoided. All in all an unpleasant experience as no comfort and dirty place.
"Used Chennai Airport for International arrival at 2330 and Domestic departure at 0555. Swine flu Immigration and Customs checks very swift as ours was the only plane arriving. The baggage though took more than 15 minutes to arrive on the belts. Had to walk just 5 mins to the domestic terminal for the early morning departure. ""Tired looking"" is an understatement for the domestic terminal. There were more than 100 passengers waiting for morning domestic flights after international arrival. No proper seating arrangements and many were sitting or sleeping on the floor. Toilets were awful and stinking. The whole terminal building is in a miserable condition."
Used Chennai airport for domestic arrival and intl departures last week. The new domestic arrival is now part of the intl terminal and is new. Took 10 minutes from plane to curb side (no checked bags). very impressed. The arrivals hall is spacious and well lit. Intl Departures has been a consistently good experience over the past 2-3 years. My flight departed at 21:30 so customs immigration and security all deserted. Immigration officials in Chennai more civil and polite than Delhi. overall good experience.
From plane to car took no more than 20 minutes which was great but airport itself looked very old and tired. Flew home from different airport (the modern but awful Cochin) so was spared the departure experience.
The facilities for transfer passengers domestic flight to international with a long wait between flights are poor. There is only one very small and not good quality restaurant. There is no where to rest in reasonable comfort.
I used Madras Airport twice in the space of five days: once for an international departure and once in transit. Departing at noon the airport was not particularly busy. Nevertheless checking in at the Jet Airways counter (Premiere) took forever - it seemed the party ahead of me with more than one piece of checked baggage per head completely brought down the entire system. Lounge comfortable security swift but I fail to understand how so many passengers passed security and boarded our flight with three or even four pieces of hand baggage. Boarding through Gate 5 (bus gate) which is absolutely awful in terms of state of disrepair and trash all over the place. A few day later I was in transit from Colombo to Frankfurt and upon arrival was asked to leave my ticket and passport with a member of ground staff who eventually returned with my boarding card in hand more than two hours (!) later. Why not have a simple transit desk as everywhere else in the world?
Chennai Intl terminal is vastly improved since I last visited. Immigration counters on arrival side were staffed well and special attention was given to passengers traveling with children (like us). We were asked to move to an empty line meant for special category of travelers the staff made sure no one else piggy backed on us and other passengers with similar needs were also helped. The baggage area is more spacious and well lit. Exiting the terminal is also a little better as you are buffered from the meet and greet crowd very efficiently. But it was the Intl departure area that has improved more there are more shops and duty free (most items are over priced but they were running 2 for 1 deals on some brands of liquor). A new section has opened up which houses the AI Maharajah lounge as well as the BICA lounge. Security is still a big pain with long queues and the odd passenger trying to break in. Make sure you have a baggage tag on all carry on items (the ones where you write your name for ID that you find at the airline check in desk) security uses this to stamp on. If you don't have one then they will send you back. There is a smoking room past security. For the male traveler restrooms are just barely acceptable not sure about the ladies room. Jet Airways doesn't require you to Xray your bags before check in as they do it inline after check in.
Recently went through MAA for an international flight for the first time in a long while. The interior is still rather drab much like the Indian airports of yesteryear but the airport is much less congested than Delhi or Mumbai. Upon entry signage for the baggage screening machines (i.e. which one to use for your airline) is poor so you end up having to guess. Immigration counters were well-staffed and took no time at all and customs no longer goes out of their way to harass you like they used to 10 years ago. Shopping/food is dreadfully limited inside the terminal so if you need something to eat try the small food court outside the departures entry gate (the Anjappar restaurant serves decent local fare) or the restaurant on the second floor between the international and domestic terminals. The best thing about MAA is that unlike BOM or DEL the domestic and international terminals are next door to each other so if you have an inbound/outbound domestic connection it's a short 5 minute walk over - thus saving you from getting harassed for tips by the touts running the terminal shuttles or getting ripped off by the taxi/auto drivers.
"Arrivals has continuously improved in the past 4 years. Passport control quick. Luggage arrival may take a while (30 mins to 1 hour); Customs is quick and easy. Smoking permitted inside terminal - a nuisance. Duty free can be purchased upon arrival not much of a choice though. Basic stuff. Foreign exchange - Thomas Cook office within the secure area available. Free local phone call permitted from assistance booth near baggage collection area. Most staff speak good english and respond well. Long-distance / international calls can be placed from telephone booths (labeled ISD/STD) which are manned and you can get receipts. If you have someone to pick you up at the airport: Clear customs; Exit immediately after customs and wait there. You will turn left to exit the ""secure area"". Do not do this unless you have seen the people waiting to receive you. If you have do not have someone to pick you up: Clear customs; Exit and as you turn left you will see two private travel agencies within the secure area (one is Akbar travels and the other is Airport Express). Both of them are prepaid safe reliable. Akbar costs 350 rupees (less than 10 USD) (as of Aug 2008) to a ride anywhere in to Chennai city. Tip the person who rolls your luggage (about 20 to 30 rupees); and tip the driver about the same. Walk very closely to the person who takes your luggage to your car since you might get lost in the crowd outside. MAA International Departures: Arrive at least 3 to 4 hours prior to departure time. Must have a ticket / itinerary printed and in your hand with passport to get in to the airport. No other options allowed. Check-in queues are very long and slow. Elite status helps (depending on airline). No food for purchase prior to check-in. Passport control is usually quick (max 30 minutes with a 100 people in line). Duty free available. Overpriced food available prior to and after security check (for your handbags etc). The food is actually good in the mornings (between 6 to 9:30 AM) and after that its not that great. Make sure you have a luggage tag for your hand baggage - this is true for all Indian airports. They will make you leave the line and go and get one. Also make sure you have exactly one piece of hand baggage...no matter what it is.(so fit everything in to one bag). Did not use any lounges. MAA Local airport: NEed ticket with ID to enter airport. Some food available prior to check-in. All luggage is screened with X-ray machines similar to international airport. These queues are long. Otherwise its generally quick to get through to check luggage and clear security. Individual airlines may be slow depending on quality of service. After security check there is extremely overpriced stuff to eat. A coffee dispensing machine. Its pretty boring otherwise. Nothing to do except people-watch. Most airlines need you to take a bus to the plane. Watch for the gates being called out. You could easily miss the call - but they track you down anyway if they know you checked-in."
I have lived in Chennai for over 25 years and currently reside in USA my home for the last 10 years. Frankly Chennai airport is a nightmare. Having lived in India for long I can put up with less-than-sparkling toilets but what amazes me is the perennial air-conditioning problems in the airport. It is not that air-conditioning technology is rocket science. It has been in vogue for almost 100 years now. Why then is it so difficult to make the air-conditioning effective? The nearly year-long hot and humid weather of Chennai makes the airport suffocating. I really pity the westerners who have to put up with this fuming and sweating. Other attractions of Chennai airport include glum-faced immigration inspectors who cannot smile or even utter a word of welcome to foreigners visiting our country indifferent and unhelpful airport staff etc. The sooner all airports are privatized in our country the better.
We have gone through Chennai Airport recently in 2006 and again just a few weeks ago. Even last year the airport was better than I had expected. This year the improvements to the International Terminal main hall are immense more seating gleaming floors and it seemed slightly less chaotic than our previous transit through it. Tea coffee cold drinks and snacks are available and the facilities are clean enough. Even the arrival and baggage collection on our inbound sector was fine. Despite the fact that the A/C isn't up and running yet I would certainly have Chennai as my airport of choice for entering/leaving India.
With major renovation works almost complete MAA is now more convenient particularly for domestic travellers. There are now two separate check- in areas for all domestic carriers as opposed to only one previously (which was always overcrowded). So checking-in (and particularly baggage screening) is less stressful. Also: new are separate airline lounges but I am not sure whether they are a real improvement. For one the combined Paramount/Sahara lounge does not serve any beer whereas the airport restaurant does. Second all the new lounges lack windows - the airport restaurant offers a spectacular view across the tarmac and runways. Security uncrowded despite my flight departing at 18.50. I checked the prices at the refreshment stand in the departure lounge and the prices are effectively daylight robbery (Rs 60 for a can of Coke). Still a lack of airbridges and most domestic pax have to be taken by bus. At Madras as at most Indian airports there seems to be a competition among airlines as to who can offer the most inaccessible airport bus - with some having you negotiate 4 steps to get on and off. Underslung bus chassis have been around since before WWII so what happened?
Not a bad little airport. Always a scrum before check-in unless you are travelling in business class but generally ok facilities and duty free a bit sparse but fairly clean.
I arrived late at night and had an early morning flight to Hyderabad so had to spend the night in the Domestic terminal. Airport itself is quite clean compared to others in India. Airconditioning ineffective so the airport itself was very humid. There seems to be a real mosquito problem in this airport. Overall it was clean security is a joke. Not too many shopping options or food options but tea and coffee as well as candy are available. There is a full time restaurant on the 2nd floor although I didn't try it out. International arrivals hall is surprisingly clean - okay airport for Indian standards.
Chennai airport is superior to the other Indian international terminals namely Delhi Mumbai and Hyderabad. You have to wait to get in through the front doors but it's usually in the 15-20 minute range as opposed to the nearly one hour cattle stampede I had to deal with in Hyderabad. I wouldn't call the ground crews friendly but they are reasonably efficient and the majority of the flights leave on time. Security and immigration queues are long but not unbearable and definitely shorter than what you have to deal with in Delhi or Mumbai. The A/C doesn't work great but I haven't found an airport in India where it actually does. Overall not great but a tolerable experience.
"It's not that bad. Look for the ""retiring rooms"" bookable with the airport manager at the domestic terminal 900 rupees or 650 for a family. If your flight doesn't leave until some unearthly hour use this facility. HBO on the TV 2 beds fridge air con. Hot shower. Don't want to spend money go to the flight viewing deck on the 2nd floor. It's got a cafeteria cooling fans reasonably quiet seating cleaner toilets if you use the ones down the airlines office block on this floor."
We travelled through Chennai on 5 August arriving from Mumbai connecting to Columbo on Jet Airways. Incoming flight was delayed and I cannot praise the Jet Airways groundstaff who ensured we met our connection enough. They seperated our luggage out personally escorted us through every stage of the transit and escorted is on to the plane. Everything is relative after the horrors of Mumbai airport I found Chennai airport clean and efficient.
"I often use Madras for international travel as it has better and more frequent connections than Bangalore. In comparison I agree that it is one of the better airports in India particularly the international building. It is reasonably spacious given the passenger numbers and never as chaotic as for instance Delhi. The airline lounges are definitely better in Madras than elsewhere in India. What is frustrating is the basic ""Indian"" layout of having the departure gates separated from the airbridges by a common corridor also used for arrivals so you often find your boarding procedure interrupted by inbound passengers flowing past the door of your boarding gate. This morning I arrived from CMB at 9.05 a.m. passed immigration customs and was in time to check in for a 10.05 a.m. Jet Airways flight at the domestic terminal. Hard to beat!"
I fully agree with the comment from Warren Ezequiel. I couldn't believe such a long delay on immigration. The general hygiene is poor but the the toilets are the worst!!! If the local goverment wants to bring more tourist to Tamil Nadu they should think seriosly about improving the airport image since this is the gate to the country.
I have travelled through Chennai airport on several occasions in the last 3 years and have found it to be best in India so I am surprised by many of the comments. International arrivals and baggage claim facilities though primitive are a vast improvement on other airports in the country. On recent trips with LH GF and BA we were through immigration and had collected our baggage within 30mins of arrival
Arriving at Chennai airport on an international flight makes one sick. The long lines of people waiting to get their passports stamped on arrival is the beginning of all woes. The area around the conveyor belt is filthy with litter and the staff are not presentable whether it is their dress or even in being polite - this includes the immigration officer who stamps the passport on arrival. He looks at the passport photograph and then looks at the person as if the former was a criminal of some sort. Outside the airport there are umpteen beggars taxi drivers touts and the lot trying to ask one where he is going and whteher their luggage needs to be carried - even if it were a small backpack. Many NRIs of Tamil origin are ashamed of their capital city and they prefer to travel to either Bangalore Kochi or Trivandrum. With several other cities like Bangalore getting a new airport and more international flights I feel many people even to Tamilnadu will be avoiding the Chennai airport in future. The Governments involved must have sufficient police presence at both the airport and train stations to prevent tired international travellers from being harassed. Also the whole of Chennai needs a bit of education in how to be clean. If nothing is going to be done to make Chennai a safe comfortable and clean place for arrival I think it will soon lose its position as 'Gateway to the South'.
On arrival passport control was a little slow processing everyone despite our being the only international flight in at the time (A320). That said they have a job to do and I have certainly experienced much slower elsewhere. Some of our bags were already waiting by the time we reached the belt. Overall a fairly painless arrival and out of the building within 35 minutes from arrival. Departure was a pleasure. Security check and bag X-Ray as you enter the terminal. No queues at check-in. Outbound passport processing very quick. Once large departure lounge covering all international gates but it had lots of seats and a pleasant outlook over the runway. Adequate range of retail and food outlets in the waiting area. Very happy with this airport and the experience.
I find that the airport has made significant improvements and seems to have more traffic. There is hardly any waiting at check-in or for screening. An excellent regional airport with decent food outlets and reasonable prices. It is not overly cluttered with shops and stalls. This is my favourite regional airport.
It is almost a joy to fly into this airport and avoid the chaos that is Bangkok. Have arrived on Air Asia non- stop flight from KL several times over past few months and I've only been unlucky once. Departing is even quicker. A big thumbs up to whoever brought in the CIQ system when transiting BKK so you can clear immigration in CNX rather than in BKK.
This is an efficient medium-sized international gateway which I think is greatly under-utilized. AOT has done a lot in recent years to upgrade the airport with the construction of the terminal extension now used by international passenger traffic. The prices charged at food outlets here are very reasonable.
Excellent regional airport nicely split within the same terminal between International and Domestic (I used the latter). Spacious and efficient check-in on Air Asia. Plenty of places for a snack or drink. Low key and efficient security. Good signs screens and flight announcements and adequate seating at the gates.
My local airport. My comments are directed not so much at airport administrators but at King Power who run the duty free shop at CNX. They have an outlet in the arrivals hall. Despite the fact that there are only two daily nonstop flights from KL and Singapore KP deem it too late to offer a service late at night when the Air Asia flight from Singapore arrives at 2300. If you are not going to offer goods for pax on these services one has to wonder why they bother to have an outlet there in the first place? But customer service has never been a strong point with KP. I can only assume that pax off the late night flights from Incheon and Taipei suffer the same fate. Welcome to Thailand. Not a great first impression.
A facility not many people will no about but worth knowing if the need arises. I had a minor motorcycle accident en rotue to the aiport recently which left my am bloodied and dirty. After checkin I noticed a 'first aid centre' signposted on the first floor of the international departures terminal. I duly found it and the room is staffed with a qualified nurse. She cleaned and dressed the wound and sent me on my way. I had to sign a register to show that I had attended the facility and I was expecting a small charge which I would have happily paid. The cost - nothing?
The new look airport is now complete with clear distinction between domestic and international flights. I use this airport several times a month and the improvements were carried out with almost no inconvenience to passengers. It has to be one of the best regional airports around!
A small 'regional' airport that handles some international flights. Though there is a domestic and an international section if you fly Thai you must enter the international section for Thai check-ins. Going thru the initial security at the front door. Warning : all gels liquids etc must be packed in check-on bags. No allowances. Departure lounge is ok - as long as no more than 2 planes are leaving close together. Arrival (domestic) is a breeze - from plane seat to taxi seat (with carry-on) about 7 minutes. Services (food books etc) are limited. Parking in the lot is easy and 'cheap'. Close to city centre - maybe a 10 minute taxi ride. Airport shared with RTAF 41 Squadron.
Great little airport but if you cant find your bags on the domestic arrivals belt they will be in the international arrivals hall about a 5 minute walk at the other end of the airport. International departure gates have a smoking room which far superior to what is on offer at BKK as you can actually see when the plane starts boarding.
"One of the better regional airports I have visited in recent years. It is small but quite efficient. The restaurant run by Thai Airways is good and very reasonable. The domestic and international sections are now in separate ""terminals"" and construction is presently still ongoing. International customs and immigration clearance is far far better than in Bangkok."
I like its surrounding and staff are friendly. It is not as bssy as Bkk or Phuket. It is just big enough and up to the international standard to handle flights from other countries in Asia and most certainly several daily flights from BKK.
A great little airport that I've used many times for domestic flights. It is not a shopping destination like BKK but it does the job just fine.
Just back from Chiang Mai. The immigration took some time to clear although 70% of counter is open my queue hardly moved. Didn't take deal with taxi as had arranged for hotel transfer. When departing few shops and information counter. Quite amusing that luggage scanning is done on the entrance thus making a long queue outside the departure lobby. After check in pass the immigration swiftly and into a quite big empty departure hall with few duty shop open small outlet of black canyon coffee and a small massage centre.
The new international terminal is open and airlines have moved their check-in desks finally into the new terminal. It is a modern version of what existed in the old terminal although rumour has it that there will be a TG lounge in the international departures area. The same very limited choice of duty free and a black canyon coffee outlet. You still use the old domestic terminal if travelling to BKK or other Thai airports. Arrivals is a bit more pleasant with a few more immigration desks. Even more limited duty free shop which is closed for very late arrivals. Having waxed lyrical about the meter taxis this service has gone downhill. Arriving at varying times of the day from 0735 to 2330 has seen no taxis at the airport whatsoever. Not good enough. And the bus routes/timetables are as confusing as ever. Still haven't worked out why route 6/L didn't take me to the airport. It got close!
Arrived at Chiang Mai Airport on a domestic Thai Airlines flight from Bangkok after transferring from a Bangkok Airways flight from Siem Reap. Upon arrival in Chiang Mai we waited and waited for our baggage to arrive. After nearly everyone else had left with their bags we asked around and found that our bags had been sent to the international arrivals area at the other end of the airport. Although our arriving flight was a domestic one the baggage had been transferred at Bangkok (we didn't have to claim it and go through customs there
First time using CNX airport. Immigration staff are warm and friendly. Tried to amuse my daughter after a 3 hr flight from SIN. Airport is small with about 4-5 lanes for immigration clearance and 2-3 belts for baggage claim. There is about 2 fast food outlets 1 ice cream outlet 1 coffee outlet and a Thai resturant (worth the $). After passing through the customs there is only 1 duty free shop in the international terminal. Massage counter in the departure area is 2x the price in the night bazar! Overall the terminal needs to be upgraded to cope with the increasing number of passengers especially from the domestic areas. There is about 3 international flights/day and about 15-20 domestic flights/day. They are in the midst of building a new terminal. The Bangkok Airways lounge for all passengers looks very appealing!
I live in Chiang Mai and fly in/out at least 4-6 times a month. The airport has been upgraded in the 2 years I have been here and the new TG lounge is really rather nice. Typical thai decor. Adequate snacks/beverages. Why are westerners hung up on alcohol. Is it really impossible to go anywhere without consuming the stuff? BKK is only an hour away!! And that is an airline issue not the airports. Buy an overpriced beer upstairs! The restaurant upstairs is a rip-off but this is not a unique problem to CNX as it is true of just about every airport i can think of (and I travel around 70000 miles a year so i know a few). CNX has much going for it notably the close proximity to the centre of town and the recent addition of a meter taxi service which I always use and a bus service which passes the end of my street if I could just fathom out what their schedule is supposed to be!! and the ability of being able to clear immigration here off most (BUT NOT ALL) connecting flights is a real plus. Some carriers have no agreement so TG in BKK claim (and disputed by BKK customs) to transit BKK and thus benefit from this facility. I arrived in BKK on Gulf Air (GF) and found this out the hard way but no problems with Emirates. So you end up having to clear immigration in BKK travel to CNX as a domestic passenger then reunite yourself with your baggage in the customs hall by walking in 'the wrong way'. Fortunately there is no problem as the security people probably see this off every flight. And to those who dream of flights from the USA or Australia direct to CNX please stop dreaming. We have lost the non-stop narita flight into CNX so the thought of an LAX-CNX flight is sheer fantasy. So we will all be stuck with a night in BKK. A new HKG-CNX flight is about to start with Hong Kong Express. But having seen how they cancel flights from HKG to Guangzhou one wonders how long this will last. But Silk Air to SIN and Air Asia to KL is appreciated and reliable! Travel well travel safe. Then enjoy Chiang Mai. Value for money here is second to none.
Chiangmai Airport is clearly unable to cope with the rapidly increasing traffic. It is always congested and crowded. Having used the airport at least a dozen times over the past year or two I can say that almost always the flights would be delayed no matter what airline you use. Sometimes for just 10-15 minutes sometimes for several hours.
This is what a good local hub is all about. Although not very big by international standards it is a very user friendly Airport with good facilities shops bars etc. Located only about 10 minutes from the centre of town by taxi it is very easy to get to and even easier to leave from. A pleasure to use and reflective of the goodwill and even bigger welcome smiles from the people of Northern Thailand.
Surprised to learn how small Chiang Mai airport is and yet hosts many large aircraft each day (Thai A300-600 and Orient Thai B747-200). My overall impression of the airport was okay. The TG Biz/First Class Lounge was adequate had a good number of food items (better than many lounges at larger airports I've visited - namely DTW and NRT). But no alcohol (just like TG flights even in premium cabin). Too bad there is no bus transit service to town (though the flat rate of $100 baht for cab fare is not so bad).
I come from Chiang Mai. So I use this airport to get out of the city pretty regularly. The airport is quite small but it has all the the modern equipments that other international airports have. It can be crowded with passengers all day long which makes it so lively to remind you to get there early for your flight. The airport is on its way for expansion. There is some improvement on the runway and I believe the internal terminal has been upgraded to take more passengers too. I heard that in the near future there will be some inter-continental flights come to CNX regularly too. I like this idea because I can skip the overnight stay in BKK when I got to Thailand from America or Australia.
It's quite small old facility and stuffed with many amenities - post office bank duty-free souvenir shops snack bars transportation/hotel kiosk and even massage chairs. But there is not much room there. Baggage claim area can be very hard to maneuver for Airbus 300 passenger load. Interior decoration is heavy with Thai hand crafts. It's only 15-min ride from city center.
"Visited for Songkran this year. Lovely to be met by Thai dancers in traditional outfits. That's where the satisfaction ended. My phone credit had run out. There is nowhere available in the terminal to purchase a top-up. I was being picked up and could not contact my driver. ""Information services"" suggested I take a taxi into city buy a top-up at 7/11 then come back to airport. How ludicrous? No offer of using the phone. told to try public phone. Refused to give me change of baht 1000 note as that was all I had. No customer service whatsoever."
Very nice small airport easy check in with friendly staff. Plenty of seating in the airport with small selection of shops and restaurants and bars. Parking for cars very close to terminal and with plenty of spaces. Easy access to main roads when you leave the airport. Baggage reclaim very quick. A pleasure to arrive at this airport.
We arrived at Midway and departed from O'Hare so didn't experienced waits at ticket counters security etc. Once we arrived we were quickly met by an attendant as my wife had requested wheelchair assistance and were soon at the baggage carousel area. Our bags quickly arrived and we got a taxi just a few yards away. The airport is nothing fancy but in our case at least it was easy to use.
"I would like to comment on the rudeness of the Parking personnel. I was being dropped off at the airport and before I could even open the door the crazy person starts screaming ""You cant stop there"". How are people supposed to get out of the car you are not parking just getting. The time she wasted screaming was very unnecessary. The people need training on how to deal with the public doing your job is one thing but arguing with people is unnecessary. I stood and watched this idiot for about ten minutes doing the same to other cars. Two minutes is not a lifetime and Midway is getting to be the worst for dropping off and picking up passengers. The same when you pick up as soon as the car stops you are warned to keep moving. I can't stand those rude ignorant untrained people. Do they ever travel? Do they get the same treatment."
This airport is not large enough to handle the amount of passengers that go through it. It has insufficient seating due to the small nature of the terminal. Flights overlap and many passengers have trouble finding seats. Other than the lack of seating the airport is normal. The restrooms are very clean and can accommodate many so queues do not form.
Recently flown in and out of MDW as well as transited through this airport. Would not be the best airport in the world but certainly better than ORD as well as many other U.S. airports. Cannot say much about check-in times as check-in at the counter mostly avoided due to web check-in but the security checkpoint sometimes could form quite a bit of queue. However the lines are processed relatively fast so no need to be totally terrified at the scene. Airside seems to be better than landside. The concourses are actually quite spacious with lots of eateries and other shops. The concourses and the restrooms fairly clean and well maintained. No free wifi but at least power outlets are abundant. Ground transportation also fair. The orange line connects MDW with downtown so at least a reliable option is there for those wanting to visit downtown. However no direct links from the interstate to MDW. Better option than ORD especially when transiting.
I like that the gates where I as at (concourse A) there were no loud TVs or music playing. Travelling is loud enough. We don't need FOX or CNN filling our acoustic space. The free w-fi is as it should be.
Very easy to transport yourself from gate to gate. Luggage area plenty of space and good display boards to find your luggage carousel. I appreciate airports that have glass pains where you can see the airline activity from any gate and Midway creates a nice travel atmosphere. could use more shops and eaterys.
I went through and connected at Midway during the holiday season and it was very stressing. The terminals seem cramped and were extremely crowded. The food choices were overpriced and with little variety but there seemed to be some nice sit down bistros etc for people with long layovers. The terminal was easy to navigate but hard to find the amenities. We wasted 10 minutes in our little layover just to find a pay phone. As I finally took a break at the restroom I found them there. With very little time we rushed to our connecting flight which was a disaster! In our packed flight our gate had barely any seats. Now our gate waiting area had very little space so fine. I understand. But wait! They put in big business type seats to waste space. People were everywhere and people were sitting on the floor and standing.
With the new concourses it's a good domestic connecting option. Gate areas seemed clean and I could find a chair near my boarding queue. The B concourse (Southwest/ATA) is very long but there is a moving walkway down most of it. I thought the concessions were quite good but there was not enough seating in the food court area.
What a nice little airport! I was flying ATL-MDW-SEA and had a couple of hours in between flights each way. Midway was very clean and easy to navigate through. Decent selection of shops too. Flights were right on time and there wasn't much taxi time at all. We were always 1st or 2nd in line for takeoff. I will gladly fly through Midway again.
My daughter and I flew from Midway to Charlotte North Carolina in April 2003 and what a fantastic airport. We were very happy with the airport staff. The whole airport impressed us. Also in April 2003 we flew to Las Vegas from Midway : what a jolly crowd of passengers. We did have a delay but because all the passengers were in such a holiday mood it made the wait all that more bearable.
I just returned to Midway on Sunday. We decided to use the parking available there at the airport because it is very reasonable. Security however is nowhere to be found. The bus drivers do not make sure all the passengers from the parking lot is off before the departing to go home passengers come aboard. The result of this is my wallet was stolen. Welcome Home! When security was notified by me they really did not want to hear my story so I thought you might. I will never use the parking at the airport again.
"I have to agree with the the previous two comments. I was not expecting much from Chicago's ""second airport"" but wow what a great airport. Many shops and cafes. I flew in at an early hour and most everything was open. Given a choice I would much rather fly through Midway than O'hara. Just a well done airport."
"As a weekly flyer in and out of Chicago I am used to using O'hare. I went through Midway for the first time and its one of the nicest if not small airports in the US. Extremely easy to navigate eating and shopping areas are pleasant and the whole airport is very modern. It is also a snap to get to the city center on the Orange Line ""El"" train."
Just returned from a trip MDW-PHX-MDW. Wow what a change from old Midway. Chicago Midway new terminal does not even resemble the old crowded Midway airport. A lot of room around the check-in counters and in the departure hall. A large corridor that connects the departure hall with the gates area. This corridor serves as a security check-point waiting line. Very large and roomy and can accomodate easily everyone. Departed during the peak hours of 7-9 am. Large food court and decent shoping option. The new gates area is roomy with plenty of seating space. If you are unlucky to use the old gates though (Southwest still uses some of the old gates) the same old very dense area with very tired look and feel. But these are phased out gradually. When returned docked at a remote gate and had to walk quite a bit to connect to the new terminal arrival hall. Once in the arrival hall luggage carousels are quite big and not too crowded. There are security personnel that make sure before you leave that you picked the baggage that belongs to you and not someone's else. Good connection to the loop via train only $1.50. Midway is a decent less crowded alternative to O'Hare. Wish more major carriers will start serving it more often.
I departed with Delta from terminal 2 to go to Detroit to then fly to Italy via Amsterdam. Terminal two lacks in outlets and other similar amenities but I only stayed there for a short while so no need. On the return I flew United from Pisa to Chicago via Munich. The international terminal five is horrible. We arrived at peak hour and it was hopeless. There were dozens of flights from Europe and Asia that all seemed to arrive at the same time. This caused lines that stretched almost down the entire hallway just to go through passport control. After that the baggage hall was chaotic. With mountains of luggage being taken off early from the conveyor belt just to make room for more flights. The entire terminal unnavigable with the amount of craziness that was going on. There was a line that stretched through the baggage hall and all around it just to get land side. The line took an hour an if someone had any connections they wouldn't be able to catch them. If Chicago O'hare wants to be able to handle A380s and more planes they are going to need lots of renovations.
"I understand O'Hare is remarkably busy and has the weather to contend with so I do extend some grace for the reality induced by the moderately rainy day of my travel. However, the services, staff, lines, even the terminals themselves seem worn out and tired - exhausted from the constant fight-or-flight existence the airport lives under. I'll spare the details of my experience, only noting I was delayed, cancelled, and delayed again while just trying to pass through on a connector home. As I had extra time on my hands I decided to people-watch and experience the airport. People running from one place to another with frantic gazelle-like dodging and suitcases in tow. Others growing roots on burdened chairs while they wait with a hopeful stare at the stand-by list. Missed flights, pilots timing out, gate changes, and a maelstrom of reluctant airline refuges just looking for escape. Personnel were usually trying to be helpful, to their credit, but honestly inside I think they knew they were just plugging holes in the Titanic - praying to make it to the end of their shift. Problems if you need to get to the buses and shuttles. Down there, around the bend, back up an elevator? The midnight group of us were on a quest to find the final sign depicting 'Door 2.' The next day at 6.45am I returned with the hope times had improved but sure enough there were already the runners, the sitters, and the delayed flights all displaying the new day's same experiences for would-be travelers through O'hare. Does it need to be this way? O'Hare - it's time for a big disruptive change in flexible workflow and smart throughput, a desperate need for profound innovation."
"I recently had to transit through Chicago O'Hare from American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight to London. Passengers who transit from AA to BA Transatlantic can now transfer Air Side between Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 International Departures, this means that there is no additional security to go through once you have cleared security at your original US departure airport for the domestic segment. Transer from the domestic to the international terminal took a matter of minutes & was so easy to do which meant no more rushing to get to the transit system and then go through security again. Anyone can now transfer now with ease and no stress, we just need to have the same for inbound and that will make the whole experience much more enjoyable."
"Flew from London to Chicago with BA upon arrival in Chicago I was dreading the lines for immigration and customs, however to my surprise no lines at all! I was through immigration, customs and re-checked my luggage all within 25 minutes which is amazing. It is still a shame that there is no airside transfer between terminals but I am sure that will come as passengers who are travelling with BA to London & who transfer from a AA or American Eagle flight can now use the shuttle to transfer between terminal 3 to terminal 5 international departures. Otherwise a great experience with good facilities for passengers."
Easy signage. Food and quality moving to higher level. Charging stations improving. More will have to be added quickly. New airport map is available and excellent. Luggage moves quickly to luggage belts. Concourses clean. Maybe brighten or modernize to freshen up. 
The Airport terminal looks decent. But sadly it lacks facilities that even Mumbai has. Fewer charging points no free wifi. A really horrible airport.
"Terrible airport many flight delays because of ""weather"". De-icing policy is ridiculous. Avoid this airport unless final destination is Chicago. Try MSP as far more reliable alternative."
They are horribly organized. With delays and lost luggage common (especially when changing airlines) just avoid the airport in general. They have some cleaner restrooms but that's the only real positive to them it seems. Limited food choices long distances between terminals with no easy way to get between them. Just avoid this airport.
"Just flew home to O'Hare yesterday afternoon. The customs experience was fine using the kiosks. But then you must deal with people. A woman shouted at me to go to number 43! I looked at that station and there was a man there with no passengers so I went straight to his booth. He screamed at me ""I did not call you"". I picked up my passport and papers and began to retreat at which point he said ""Come here!"" I told him the woman had directed me to his booth but he said again ""I did not call you!"" He then began to ask me a series of questions in a loud angry tone. Welcome home to Chicago!"
Very slow and long trip to the trains. Food options are limited and expensive. Signage poor and confusing. Security staff too busy chatting and joking amongst themselves instead of doing their job and clearing big queues. It could be different to US citizens though but definitely an airport to avoid. Plus you have to have to clear and check in your luggage. I missed my connection.
I've travelled about 10 times to the US this year it was a nightmare. We flew into O'Hare on Saturday 19th July 2014. The queue for passport control was incredible long - they were told that it would be more than a 3 hour wait and it turned out to be a total nightmare for us. O'Hare is incredibly badly organised. We asked if there was a separate line for families with kids but it was not. The people who were controlling the traffic were rude. How do you wait with two children under 10 (one 14 months old) in a queue that long after a 9 hour transatlantic flight? Dreadful. This is not the first time they or we have experienced long queues of this nature at O'Hare. Nothing seems to be done about it - why?
Immigration for non US citizens at this airport has always been bad but our last visit in July 2014 took us 2.5 hours. There were only two booths open to serve a massive snaking queue. Often they would stop to chat just to keep us all waiting a bit longer. It's not about security it's just an opportunity for big brother to treat you as they please. And there's nothing you can do about it. They love giving passengers a hard time because that is there mindset. Welcome to the USA!
My daughter and three little grand-daughters flew into O'Hare (they live in Chicago) late on Friday 8th August 2014. The queue for passport control was ridiculously long - they were told that it would be a 3 hour wait as 10000 passengers on 25 flights had turned up around the same time. It turned out to be a total nightmare for them. O'Hare is incredibly badly organised. How do you wait with three children under 7 (one 4 years old) in a queue that long after an 8.5 hour transatlantic flight? Dreadful. This is not the first time they or we have experienced long queues of this nature at O'Hare. Nothing seems to be done about it - why?
Flew to O'Hare on a trip from Lubbock-Beijing. The American Airlines Terminal is very large and takes a long time to get from one gate to another the terminal however has a good selection of facilities and is quite clean. The check in was actually pretty fast and the counter agents were helpful security however is the other way around the lines are very long and slow the staff working at security are rude and aren't very helpful. Not a good airport for accessibility but has a good selection of food and retail services.
"My wife my daughter and I flew into O'Hare in 2012 in order to go to a wedding. Admittedly our flight was late departing from Heathrow but when we arrived at O'Hare we had about 2 hours to spare before the departure of our connecting flight. That however wasn't enough time to get us through security and customs. We missed our connection. The information available was poor and only a few clearance desks were staffed. Our requests to be fast-tracked fell on deaf ears. My wife and I are both elderly and we had to stand for about an hour and a half in an over-heated terminal building as the ""snake"" slowly moved forward. We enjoyed our stay but I'm not going through that again."
"Flew Heathrow to Chicago then onward to Omaha. This required claiming baggage passing through customs and immigration then handing over baggage and transferring terminal. Fair enough but it would have been better if the people collecting the luggage for the onward flight weren't just piling it in a corner (not exactly what you expect in these hyper-security conscious times) one of the shuttle trains hadn't been out of action and a TSA agent who decided that he wasn't happy with the location of the desk and adjusted it by less than an inch before every passenger. I think my colleague ticked him off by standing about 6 inches past his sign saying ""wait here to be called forward"" so he was making a point to slow everyone down. Very petty and a great first impression for my first trip to the US. Fortunately everyone else we met was lovely! Terminal 1 is pretty big with lots of small kiosks and a few sit down places but lacks proper eating places as are found in Heathrow Gatwick Edinburgh etc.. Flying back we wanted dinner but could only really get a snack."
O'Hare is enormous and always busy but in spite of that it is well organized. The signage is clear and easy to understand. The security line which may look daunting at first moves quickly. Once through any domestic security checkpoint you can access all domestic terminals (1-3). There is a wide variety of places to eat and drink or grab something quick at a broad range of prices. While not a shopping mall like many newer airports there are plenty of places to shop and browse. The Blue line train is an inexpensive and reliable way to get to or from downtown Chicago or its neighborhoods. I use O'Hare regularly and find it as tolerable as any airport - none of which I would describe as pleasant places to spend time. The main complaint I hear is from non-US citizens arriving at the International Terminal (Terminal 5) waiting in very long lines. I have experienced long lines when arriving as a non-citizen at airports around the world so this does not appear to be a problem unique to O'Hare.
"My experience was pleasant flying from ORD's newly remodelled Terminal 5. No hassles through TSA on the way out and no headaches coming back in. The new shops are lovely but pricey and it was fun passing time in the duty free shop. We did not encounter any rude or indifferent employees. What I liked best about my return through ORD is the passport control process. While the traditional process is still available for US Passports they also offer (at no cost) kiosks that get you through the process much quicker. The kiosks are in the room after TSA's ""Trusted a Traveler"" portals; I made the mistake of trying one of those out first. Baggage and customs were a breeze too. So ORD is now my first choice if I'm flying international."
I travelled on AA connecting from CDG and then transferring from Terminal 5 to Terminal 3 on an American Eagle flight to BWI. I was extremely nervous even though I had 2 hours to connect. I was amazed that it took me just 30 minutes to pass through immigration customs and security! Since my transatlantic leg was 40 minutes ahead of schedule I was ready for my next flight before my first flight was even scheduled to land. Although the connections process was seamless and efficient Terminal 3's L concourse is pretty dark and dreary and the facilities are nothing to write home about. Overall a positive experience.
A chaotic and unpleasant experience I wouldn't want to repeat unless I had to. Very slow journey to and from airport on train to centre. Food options in terminal 5 very limited and expensive. Signage around airport very poor and confusing. Security staff too busy chatting and joking amongst themselves instead of doing their job and clearing big queues.
Read many of the reviews here and agree to avoid this airport at all costs especially if flying International and connecting to a domestic flight. I was very lucky to get through Immigration-Customs in about 20 mins just happened to be at the right place and time but I did notice behind me a very long line which I believe was for Non US citizens. I was lucky to get through Customs in the amount of time I did and I barely made my flight (had 1.5 hrs). Also the staff here seem to be very impersonal and not friendly - a sharp difference when you travel throughout Asia and Australia where them seem more willing to help. Unfortunate as for many visitors to the U.S. this will be their first impression and maybe their last. Terminal 5 and Terminal 1 seem to have plenty of Restaurant and shopping choices. Also the structure seemed to be updated. But didn't have much time here and was running from landing at Terminal 5 to catch my connection to Terminal 1. You have to take a train from Terminal 5 to the Domestic Terminals (keep in mind you also have to recheck baggage if landing here first coming from International) so if you have 2 hrs it may be just enough time.
ORD is one of the world's busiest airports in terms of both passengers and aircraft movements so it is to be expected problems might arise. I've been flying in and out of here for over 30 years and I love the place. Food? Depends where you go: Terminals 1 and 3 are pretty good but Terminal 2 could use improvements and Terminal 5 has a long way to go. United and American Airlines are in terminals 1 and 3 respectively which explains why those have the best offerings. The security lines aren't all that bad and I find the customs officials to be pretty good. Also ORD is fairly clean something that most airports of its size and stature are not.
U.S. Citizens were let through immigration in minutes the rest of us were kept waiting for 3 hours. We missed our connection of course. What was truly offensive though was the lack of attention paid to this second group only two booths were open (in contrast to 6 for citizens) and the officials had seemingly no concern for the steadily lengthening line. Amazingly they would exit the booths to chat. I've never been treated this way in a U.S airport before. Shocking.
Yes it is huge with incredible crowds but terminals were relatively efficient and the lines relatively short. Only problem I had was with a car starter at cab company who seemed to have no empathy for someone who was not familiar enough with the airport to realize that there is no Terminal 4. Other than that the ground staff were very nice.
Four hour wait to get through immigration so missed my connecting flight. Absolutely useless - no queue management or information small children crying. Most emerging market airports are far superior.
The immigration performance at terminal 5 is the worst I have experienced anywhere in the world in my 30 years as a frequent international traveller. I landed at 2.10 pm joined the long line for non US immigration at 2.25 pm and was finally processed at 4.45 pm. There were only 3 immigration booths open for non US travellers whilst many more were open for residents and US citizens. The staff managing the lines were most unhelpful and bullied people along in a brusque manner. There were families with young children elderly people clearly uncomfortable with the delay. At first I thought I was unlucky on this particular day but frequent visitors in the line told me this was pretty true to form. I am a frequent traveller to the USA and I can honestly say I have never had more than 40 minutes to wait at immigration at other international airports. If indeed this performance is typical I will make it a point in future never to come in again through O'Hare on an inbound international flight. Baggage of course had been taken off the belt and it took me another 10 minutes finding my bags with no signage nor anyone there to ask. The delay meant I missed my pre-booked shuttle to downtown and had to pay again for a taxi. All in all the experience was extremely poor.
First time out of O'Hare and as a British passport holder we are normally good as a Nation for complaining. But my experience as a full fare paying First Class ticket holder on United Airlines out of Terminal One was just plain disgusting. Never seen so many uninterested employees. Self check-in when you have paid for a First Class ticket should be an experience above the normal but here no. United have no policy to make you feel different whether you are. Coach or first? No disrespect to Coach my normal travel would be by that means but just on this occasion I provided what I thought would be nice experience. So no directions given when I checked in no mention that the First Class lounge was closed for refurb. So now with meal voucher and a couple of drinks vouchers I'm back down to Coach level facilities. I might as well purchased a day ticket for the United Club and saved $3000 on the airfare. Truly a well deserved low level expectation airline matched by an equally poor and run down airport. Avoid UA and avoid O'Hare most of all avoid any First Class with UA because they see you no different from any other Coach passenger.
I fly though O'Hare 2 or 3 times a year I have never had to long to wait at customs / immigration this year I have only had to wait 30 minutes each time the TSA are friendly and polite any cuts caused by the sequester seem to have been absorbed well I see less TSA people sat round (probably on a break) then before the cuts I have not had any problems at the airport over the years the terminal is always clean and tidy. Departures at T5 at O'Hare has had a major upgrade in July the old lines have gone and you now go though a bigger and faster screening area they also found room to include a large duty free area after you pass security there is a surprise! This seems to be where the old food court used to be all the food courts that were on the upper level at T5 are now airside and the prices seem to be a little lower than last year. T5 is the best of all the terminals at O'Hare since it is smaller then the others so there is less walking time to get around it the car parks are just outside and Coach USA are outside every hour they offer good value travel (go their web site to see where they go) the train to other terminals comes around every 10 minutes and takes a few minutes to get to T2 the roads around the airport can be confusing but that can be said about most airports.
We flew home from here after a recent holiday. We had flown out of London Heathrow and found the contrast quite surprising. Upon arrival we self checked our bags which was fairly straightforward. We were then unsure which way to go for security. One member of staff directed us to the wrong place but we eventually found where to go. There was a long queue although it did move reasonably quickly - it probably took about 15 minutes. One thing that surprised us was that under 12s or over 70s did not need to remove their shoes for security checks - surely if someone is a risk everyone is a potential risk no matter their age? Once on the concourse we were unsure where to go and wait. There is basically a long corridor with a few shops and nowhere to sit other than the departure gates. We therefore had 3 hours to kill and not a lot to fill the time with. I would have happily browsed a shopping area and probably spent some money on last minutes gifts. It also felt odd having no designated sitting area prior to our gate being open. Not a user friendly airport considering the amount of time you need to spend there.
Today was my first trip to O'Hare in nearly 20 years. I've avoided it like the plague always opting for Midway when having to fly to a Chicago for a reason. Too big too inconvenient too impersonal. Today I had no choice and I was curious to see if it had changed. It hasn't except for appearing more crowded and run down than I remember. I always liked Chicago for the friendliness of its people but I can only assume that most of the people who work at O'Hare are not from this area. Unsmiling tired looking indifferent employees who seem pained to have to engage with you. They all look like they hate their jobs and why wouldn't they? If I had to work here and have to deal with these same people on a day to day basis I'd be unhappy too. Back to Midway at any cost! BTW I am only talking about a Terminals 1 and 2 United's terminals. The others might be great - I wouldn't know.
I really have no problem with O'Hare. It's a mess getting to the airport but traffic is hardly their fault. There's wifi here and outlets spread around. The food's not that great but it's an airport. I always breeze through security so I don't really have a problem. Employees seem very friendly especially for Chicago. I think this place gets a bad rap.
I've been through this airport twice now (transferring from domestics to international the first time and from international to domestic the second time). My first experience was decent
I am a British citizen and have visited Chicago many many times over the past 20 years and usually felt welcome. However this fine city is now totally let down by the incompetent management of arrivals procedures at O'Hare Terminal 5. The reality that I experienced on arrival into O'Hare T5 on September 24 was anything but welcoming. There was a 2 hour line for immigration followed by indifferent/rude airport and airline employees in the baggage claim area. Ironically in the weeks before this visit Chicago was being promoted as a welcoming tourist destination in commercials on UK TV networks. I fully understand that the Mayor's tourism dept. does not control the activities of Dept. of Homeland Security or airline employees and while I can respect that immigration procedures are very necessary for the security of US borders it is completely ridiculous to use resources to promote the city in overseas TV markets but then not adequately resource immigration procedures to facilitate those visits. Right now flying into O'Hare T5 = undesirable experience.
This is by far the most disorganized airport visited in my life long lines everywhere slow and rude officers no air conditioning dirty bathrooms.
Flew DUB-ORD-SNA and on this occasion ORD was a breeze to connect to onward flight as I had already pre-cleared Customs/INS at DUB (AA Flight) so it arrived at T3 (Domestic) and only had to walk about 6-8 gates for next flight also from T3 whole process only took about 15mins which beats hands down the 3hrs plus you can normally expect at ORD for INS/Customs/Transfers etc.
Good points: Automatic toilets - seat covers change automatically. Conveniently located. More flights compared to midway airport - more options and flexibility. Bad points: Very rude careless anti-social airport staff. TSA agents as someone said bark at you. International ticketing agents are mostly good. Confusing directions to terminals ticketing areas and parking lots. Insufficient announcements on gate changes and inadequate seating in front of many gates. Insufficient charging outlets. No free Wi-Fi and customer service for missed flights and cancellation inadequate. Have to wait hours to re-book flights. Delays to go through immigration and catch connecting flights. Chaotic. Parking close to terminals $50 a day. Old and smelly underpasses connecting terminals.
It has got to be the most disorganised airport I have been through. We landed at the international terminal and went through immigration and customs and made our way to the domestic terminal to catch our next flight. It was only because we had a rough idea of where to go from a previous experience that we got to the front of the queue to go through security into the domestic terminal. Two lines were open of about 15 lines checking passports and hand luggage. Shortly after we got to this stage there must have been at least 150 people behind us. I am certain some of these poor people must have missed their connections. 3 years previous we had 1.45 hours to do the same thing and missed our connection because there were not enough security lines open. We sat in the airport for 8 hours waiting for a flight. Allowing time for immigration customs trekking to the other end of the airport and going through the inefficient security gates you require at least 4 hours. The last flight to come home was very disorganised we changed gates twice and no one seemed to know what they were doing. After all this I don't suppose any one will take any notice.
Flew into ORD July 5 and returned to UK on 13 July. Was pleasantly surprised by speed of customs/immigration at T5 around 10am as I was able to use the 'Green Card' line as a Canadian citizen. Very quick connection to Blue Line and into Chicago. On way back flew out of T1 very disappointed with the sole duty free shop - ridiculous!
I have flown internationally many many times but only through San Francisco. This week my wife and I had to go through Chicago's O'Hare and it was horrible! For some reason the people that run the immigration and customs have decided to automate the process yet they still had bungling fools directing people and checking documents. The people checking documents who we assumed were immigration officers had no clue. The immigration people took our customs paperwork which are usually taken by the customs officers after you get your baggage. Several immigration officers had piles of them on their check-in desks. At immigration they make you go to a computer that scans your passport then takes your photo. If you are travelling with someone it takes theirs along with yours. We then get a major surprise: one officer is checking everyone's baggage all 300 of us from the flight from Germany! The line is very long and very slow. I can only imagine some older couple getting extremely stressed out by this process.
The lack of outlets for charging accessories is absolutely ridiculous in 2013 every location to grab a drink had no availability. Airport needs a serious update.
Just flown international out of Terminal 5. The facilities in the departure lounge are almost non-existent. There is a small Korean cafe a Mexican cafe with small bar and two bar carts. Apart from buying sandwiches and soft drinks from shops these are the only means of eating and drinking. Nothing warns you about the lack of facilities before you go through security. When you complain you are just told that other facilities will be available at the end of the year. This is of no help when you are looking for a meal. The two small cafes are so busy that they are now doing take-aways. It says it all when there are very limited facilities for eating and drinking but there is a large duty free shop.
We recently flew into O'Hare airport when we arrived from Charlotte NC. We had a late night arrival. So late that nearly everything was closed. The restrooms thankfully were not and they were spotless. We were able to Locate the Blue line to get to our destination. A man helped us to figure out what to do once we got there. On our departure from Chicago we were able to print our boarding passes pass through screening and the ticketing area in about 15 minutes. There were many food vendors and stores we could buy food from and we even saw that you could get a massage. We had to wait about an hour but it was not an unpleasant wait. The NSA staff and airport staff were all pleasant and helpful.
Very old very outdated very antiquated. The long lines the shuttling between terminals the lack of plugs for cell phones and lap tops and the rude staff was enough to make me never go through there again. Please update this tacky monstrosity and modernize it.
Generally I complain about Chicago's airports but this time I had no issues. Staff was quick and efficient and I was able to be through everything very rapidly. Luggage was quick and waiting for me upon my return no problems at all. Food choice could be better.
Terminal 5 is an absolute nightmare for non US travelers. United booked my flight with a 1.5 hrs connection. Flying out there was a uniformed man who called passengers off our flight to a free immigration booth after waiting for half an hour. Since there were many hundreds of people jammed into the immigration hall we would never have made our flight. Coming back no such luck. After waiting for 45 minutes in the incredible line up which appeared to consist of a thousand people I pleaded with the girl directing US residents and she let me into this line. After picking up my luggage and re checking with united I had twenty minutes to get to terminal 2 before my flight left. I still had to go through security in terminal 2. I made it just but my baggage didn't. How can they possibly justify having two customs officials to deal with this enormous number of people.
We passed through this airport twice in a week once from UK and then from Mexico. On both occasions we were met by huge queues for passport check both times taking 2-3 hours to get through. As we made our way towards immigration we were ordered by a young lady to 'stand against the wall' get against the wall'. We queued there for about 45 minutes before getting to a hall best described as a cattle market crammed with hundreds of visitors. People were taking photos of the unbelievable crowd. Only about 1/3 of passport desks were manned. It took 2 hours to get through the queue plus the 45 minutes in the corridor. Many people were missing connecting flights. When they asked staff what they should do they were rudely told 'stand in line there's nothing you can do you just have to catch the next one'. I guess for some that meant spending the night in the terminal. One parent tried to offer food to their bored child only to be ordered to 'put that food away- no food' because they were using sniffer dogs. There was not a hint of courtesy politeness or helpfulness in any of the staff. US citizens seemed to be getting through in about 15 minutes. This was obviously not an isolated incident since it was the same on both occasions we passed through. This is the worst airport I have ever passed through. They should not be allowed to take international flights if they think it is reasonable to treat the passengers this way.
We arrived from UK with about an hour to get off the British Airways flight get through immigration collect our cases hand them in again and get to the next terminal by the transit train. As we taxied to a stop the pilot said all those with immediate connecting flights would find an orange envelope on the wall when we got to the end of the airbridge just wave this as we went through the airport and we be rushed through. I have to say it all worked like clockwork. As we approached immigration a lady directed us into a short queue of about ten people. (The main queue snaked around for several hundred yards). We were through in about ten minutes and although our luggage with the red labels came after numerous ones without we found the new bag drop counter and jumped on the train to the next terminal. Our flight boarded whilst luggage was still turning up on the tarmac but when we arrived at New Orleans. The success of this was due to having both flights booked by BA so they were responsible for getting us to the final destination. From previous reports I had read of Chicago I had no faith in making New Orleans on this last flight of the night so I can only say thanks to BA and the staff at Chicago for making the experience efficient and pleasurable.
Arrived at O'Hare from London yesterday to face longest immigration line that I've ever seen in many years of travelling worldwide. In essence it took me 3 hours of waiting to be processed! Yes I repeat 3 hours! I can only say that I was appalled to be treated so badly. Is this the way to treat visitors to the US who are a vital source of revenue for the country? I love Chicago and the US but was very disappointed by the complete disregard for visitors shown by US Immigration management. The solution is simple: employ more people and have sufficient staff on at busy times. The people who were in that line yesterday all went away with a very bad impression and will no doubt avoid flying into Chicago in the future.
Got to airport 2.5 hrs early for an early evening American Airlines flight to Tampa. T3 security was good (got through in 20 minutes) but our gate (K1) has virtually no seating. Gate is located right outside security but there were less than 50 seats at the gate which is typically used for mainline flights. Most other gates have sufficient seating however. There is a decent choice of food but the majority of it is (at least in T3) located in a food court where Conc. H and K split off from each other and could possibly be a 5 minute walk to the food court not to mention the wait to get your food.
I read all the recent reviews and thought ORD would be horrendous but contrary to the reviews the airport worked well! My family of 4 arrived in T5 on Sunday 30 Dec 2012 afternoon after more than an hour's delay in Heathrow London due to a technical fault with the aircraft and half expected to miss our flight connection as our original transit time was only 3 hr. Well we got through Immigration in 45 mins (we are all non-US citizens) retrieved our luggage from the carousel without a hitch and passed them to the United Airlines staff waiting there. We got to Concourse C for our flight to Atlanta albeit with only 20 mins before scheduled flight time. We didn't meet any unhelpful or brusque staff and we were pleasantly surprised that the airport's transfer systems (for luggage and passengers) all worked as they ought. As a bonus the airport also has a good choice of dining places plus the fun brachiosaurus in Concourse B.
The worst airport I have transited through. If you're coming to the USA through this airport and you're not a citizen or a green card holder - avoid. I transited through this airport twice and each time the wait at immigration was over 2 hours. If you don't want to miss a connecting flight you need at least a 4 hours layover to be on the safe side. I missed a flight and the airport personnel refused to help me to make it on time.
Flown into Terminal 3 and then waited for others at Terminal 1/2. Although it is not a fault of anyone this airport is just unreliable especially in the winter anyone can lose connections due to delays that can be triggered not just by snowfalls but also by mere rains coupled with low visibility. I was affected by exactly that and ended up arriving at O'Hare an hour late. Airport's location itself is already a reason to avoid this airport especially for connections. The airport offers a cheap rail link into the downtown in addition to the expressway option and considering the frequent congestion's on the expressways around Chicago sometimes the metro option is a must for travelers. Except for T5 - the international terminal - the other terminals are also nicely grouped together in the central terminal area so walking over to a different terminal is not that difficult at all there is a free and efficient Airport Transit System that links all terminals and the remote parking lots. The terminal facilities however can have some upgrades to be more appealing. Airside had seating available for passengers around each gate but landside had a very limited number of benches. The wifi was not free and even when I wanted to pay for it the signal was not even strong. The power ports were virtually non-existent. Flight information displays were lacking both in terms of its quality and its size. Information was incorrect for some delayed flights. Some flight information was not even clear as to which terminal they were expected to depart/arrive many first-timers would be in trouble finding their ways to the correct terminal/gates. Other aspects of evaluation seem to be on par with or slightly worse than most other major airports in my opinion. In short I would discourage others from flying in and out of ORD unless it is unavoidable (e.g. Chicago is their final destination). Except for the superior availability of flight options from United and American I would always choose other major hubs over ORD.
The Immigration at Chicago O'Hare is an embarrassment for both Chicago and USA. The level of service has declined to the point that it took us over one hour to clear immigration - I have flown in and out of O'Hare since 1971. In Terminal 5 there are 34 lanes on each of two sides. Of the 34 lanes about 5-6 were manned for Visitors while 1-3 were manned for Residents. One of the agents decided to take a 30 minute break while several hundred of us waited in line to clear immigration
After my earlier positive review (10 Oct) about coming IN to Chicago and then an internal flight to Savannah from O'Hare on another day we did the O'Hare - London Heathrow return. Whilst not quite as horrendous as we were told when in the security queue (2 x-ray/security machines for the whole of International / Terminal 5 departures? Really?) that there were no restaurants past security. So we found something dreadful to eat at what passes for the truly laughable 'food court' in Terminal 5. Then found some much more acceptable offerings when we got through security. The International Departures part of Terminal 5 Chicago O'Hare is fairly grim (and that is putting it mildly). All I can say is get something to eat before you get to Terminal 5 and take a good book / Kindle. There's nothing to do after Security. Come on Chicago - you're a great city - have an International Airport that matches.
We were delayed 2 hours at immigration with long queues of tired passengers. The staff marshalling us into the lines were not interested in providing any comfort or words to ease the frustration. The immigration officials were slow and limited in number to make things worse I realise that the staff were merely doing their jobs and cannot be expected to hurry up the process so I blame the management of the area and the processes involved. If this situation is a continuing one then surely some way of improving the process more staff at peak times for example should be used. The stats for arrivals are no secret the airlines know the figures so why don't the immigration department official do something about it. Or maybe nobody really cares whether we visit again or not!
Terminal 5 (international) at O'hare is one of the worst places to fly out of. The facilities including places to eat are limited to a duty free shop souvenir shop and 3 fast food restaurants and a small Bar that surround a depressing seating area. The security checkpoint is very slow and on a busy day you could end up standing in line for over an hour. After the security there are no restaurants or fast food places whatsoever. Just a couple of kiosks and news stands. The domestic terminals at O'hare are way better and have tons of options for food etc so it's surprising that they don't try to make the international terminal a bit more accommodating.
Absolutely no working electrical outlets in T3 Concourse G. I tried eight gates and could not fine any live outlets. Seems like a small thing but delays and cancelled flights mean you need computers and phones longer. I could get no work complete because my batteries died while awaiting a flight.
After awful reviews of O'Hare it was with some trepidation that I flew Heathrow - O'Hare and O'hare to Savannah. Whilst we did have to wait a while to get through passport control security baggage retrieval etc we were at our downtown hotel within 2 hours of landing. And whilst not exactly service with a smile it wasn't the worst experience either (Newark hang your head in shame). O'Hare to Savannah was a breeze on a busy Monday am - smiley helpful check in staff and very nice security people. Not much to do when through security but at least there's a variety of eating places. Not what I was expecting.
I landed and had two hours to connect. Barely made it and only because I had no checked luggage. There were 3 lines at immigration. The busiest was for transit passengers and this had the fewest staff 3 inspectors and one was missing several times. I was standing in line with hundreds of people all getting more and more desperate as they were transit passengers and many needed to get on with it. Why did the supervisor not shift some of the passengers to the green card line which was moving at a good pace? They did not do that before the green card line was completely empty. Will do my best to avoid Chicago in the future!
No signs anywhere 3 hours to go through immigration filthy toilets and staff who obviously couldn't care less. I will make a serious effort to never see this place again.
When we arrived on a flight from LHR there was a long walk to immigration. Luckily the flight before us had just about gone through and we were one of the first people off the plane so we got through in about 10 minutes. After clearing everything and at the exit there were no signs to where the Car Rental Shuttles are and there was no one about to ask. For our return flight the walkways around check-in were very narrow and congested. The queue for security was very long with a wait for about 20 minutes with 2 lanes for 'normal' people and 1 lane for business/first class. The staff just waved their fingers at you without even looking at you. Airside there are no restaurants and the only place you can get food from is a small open shop. At the gate there is also few seats lots of the passengers sat on the floor.
Facilities are disastrous (filthy/dirty restrooms malfunctioning AC system even broken escalators) security officers have no respect to passengers whatsoever staff in general are rude delays occur all the time (even at 7am when there are only 3 planes on the runways). There is almost no gate or flight information public transportation is a joke and you often have to walk long distances to reach the correct gate. The only redeeming value is the quality and variety of eateries offered. In short O'Hare is a disgrace to the city of Chicago.
"An absolutely horrible airport to transit through especially if you're coming off a domestic flight (in my case Denver) and transiting to Europe. I got off the plane and there was absolutely no information anywhere about where to go. I had to walk all the way to one end of the terminal to find a flight overview but those were only for that particular terminal and hence terminal and gate information for next flight was not on there. I had to ask for help at a random gate (where I had to say ""excuse me"" 4 times before any of the employees bothered looking at me). I was eventually directed towards terminal 5. After getting to terminal 5 which was a bit of a project in itself the line for security clearance stretched for about 100 meters without any organization whatsoever. In line I talked to some people who were going on the same flight who had had the exact same issues as well. The staff are also the rudest I have ever encountered even against the people standing in the business/first class line. No matter how good of a stay you might have had in the US this airport will almost not make you want to return anytime soon. In summary a poorly organized airport with a horribly rude staff. Avoid transiting through this airport. If you have no other choice make sure to at the very least have 2 hours between flights."
I will try to never fly through Chicago again. Everyone I have met here has been rude! Except for one security gentleman as we left customs to go to another terminal a gentleman whose service and kind attitude really stands out against everyone else's amazing rudeness. Even the ladies in our first class lounge who couldn't explain to me how it works as it's my first time in such a lounge but instead treated me with curt responses and no niceties. I am returning home from overseas and am really tired already. This kind of treatment is undignified and absolutely unacceptable.
Nearly 2 hours in immigration 4 people manning 15 channels don't they know there are wide bodied jets inbound with passengers. I use to come through ORD 3-6 times per year and its getting worse. Barely had enough time to make my connection and then when I get to terminal 1 the security queues are taking 40 minutes to process and that was the premium channel. A bad advert for the US and worse for O'Hare. If you have the option don't enter the US via Chicago.
This process is very broken. They had two lines US visitors and US citizens Canadians and people with Green Cards. The issue was very simple the US Citizens flew by and could have been processed in matter of seconds. The people with Green Cards had to go through a lengthy interrogation. Take a hint from grocery stores - for the people with the fewest items open an express line. I waited in line for 1.5 hours to take 2 minutes to process.
This airport needs to do something about its immigration and customs officers. After arriving on a slightly delayed fight from Manchester and despite the best efforts of American Airlines agents in giving out priority passes we missed a connecting flight. Firstly the immigration officer managed to mess up the finger printing on mine and my wife's passports and with a curt' you can come in' to me 'but she can't to my wife accompanied by a pointed finger. I tried to explain to him what had happened but he was not interested and we had to go and sit in a room with other none desirables. On speaking to a supervisor the problem was sorted out. Next was the customs officer after we were directed the wrong way he proceeded to shout and point at us in front of many other people I suspect this was the first time he has worn a uniform and has been in a position of power if this is the welcome you can expect on arrival at Chicago the I will avoid flying there at any cost. On our return flight they managed to direct us to the wrong terminal and only just made our flight thankfully the passport control officers were much more efficient and polite. On return to Manchester we saw how much more polite our immigration officers were to visiting US passport holders.
It is normal to wait 2-3 hours at immigration which is very tiresome when you have already travelled for many hours. There is a total lack of security officers and obviously little or no organization. The management says it is a question of security but in reality it is impossible to hide how badly organized O'Hare immigrations is.
The longest wait at immigrations I have ever experienced: over 3 hours. For a while only one booth was staffed for hundreds of people standing in line including mothers with children elderly persons in frail physical condition. Many missed their connecting flights. A nightmare.
2.5 hours immigration queue delay with 3 staff manning the area sometimes only 2 staff. With 400 or so people waiting this is very tiring and time consuming after a long flight. I understand that safety and security are vital but a few more staff present might have speeded up events at immigration. It seemed that the staff do not work as a team very well as we are asked to stand here then another person says no stand over there in that queue. Upon leaving the US the process was much faster and the staff seemed more friendly. Other than that I had a great vacation.
Have stood in line more than once to get through security for over an hour. They almost always have half the lanes closed and force customers to stand in line. Security personnel have grouchy looks on their face do not say hello do not smile and bark commands at you like you're a dog. Absolutely horrible!
United terminal is modern. Policemen on the beat can be rude unfriendly and downright intimidating. ORD staff are generally friendly. International arrivals hall a dump. CTA station to Cumberland is on the lower level and is nice and clean. I prefer travelling to the loop/North Michigan Avenue on the EL train. Report at least 4 hrs early for check-in.
In transit from Zurich to Minneapolis via ORD. An ordeal. Long waiting lines at Terminal 5 for immigration. Very slow security process in Terminal 1 for my connecting flight. Connecting time was just sufficient to get from plane to plane just in time (almost 3 hours). Lack of efficiency makes ORD a bad place to connect. The only nice thing were the friendly people at immigration and security.
Stopped here with United on my way to Roanoke (ROA) from San Francisco (SFO). This is the one to avoid. When I landed the plane took 20 mins to taxi to the gate because of the terribly organized runways. I came to find that although the terminal (Terminal 1) was clean and had plenty of eateries most were too expensive. After passing that little conglomerate eateries are next to none so it took awhile to find a decently-priced place. Finding a restroom was nightmare. I had to find Terminal 2 which took even longer than the restroom thanks to an appalling lack of signage. Terminal 2 was far too small to hold all the passengers necessary and indirectly because of that it was appallingly dirty. The flight to Roanoke got caught in traffic. There is no next time for this airport I'll use Midway if I have to.
Security (as with any US airport) takes a while and there are usually long lines. Shops and restaurants are very limited (even at T5 the international terminal). Transfer between terminals means that you need to clear immigration and customs and either take the bus or the monorail train which means that you then need to go through TSA security again. Facilities are nothing special and the terminals are generally long and narrow hence no sense of spaciousness.
The airport is large mostly clean with long security lines. But that is all ok. The thing that is not ok is that they charge for WiFi access. They have large signs that proclaim the easy use of WiFi but in fact they charge $10 per day to access. This lack of basic Internet services is enough to prompt me to take my business away from Chicago.
Terminal 2 - check-in and security lines ok but a long and dull wait for your flight if you are not a gold card fidelity member. Restaurants are limited and far too crowded along with the waiting areas.
International T5 arrivals needs more attention arrived from LHR at immigration there were long lines. It is a very hot area so frustrations do start appear with tired passengers. Authorities know what flights are arriving there should be enough people on duty to meet the demand as it is not a great first impression. Transferring between terminals needs to be improved having to leave airside to go to your connecting terminal and then go back through TSA security. I had to line up for over 1hr to go through security so with the hour long wait for immigration & the hour wait to line up and go through security you need at least 3hrs if you are transferring to a domestic flight. O'Hare does need to have an Air Side transfer to reduce lines for security in the terminals otherwise passengers will start to go to other gateway airports.
Chicago T5 for international flights is a poor facility for such a major city. Firstly the long narrow design often means long walks to check in back to security in the centre and back to the gate. Routing to the CTA train is not very well signed yes it gets you to the shuttle tram fairly well but after that getting off the tram at T1 or T2 signs are geared only to passengers flying from that terminal not passengers en route to the CTA city train on the Blue line. Surely not impossible to deal with this likely eventuality. Indeed T5 passengers are probably more likely to use CTA than the domestic arrivals. Security queues outbound at T5 can be really awful it took 1hr last Tuesday for no obvious reason. Some queues moved faster than others the one on the left next to the food court (a very small basic facility) was slowest as it was always used to pass flight crew to the top of the line. Airside there are only tiny shopping facilities no newspapers except from those machines you see on the street a small selection of mass market magazines. Of course if you want food go somewhere else or bring it with you. An extraordinary lack of initiative to ignore selling to passengers with long wait times. There are very few seats at the gates even though more seats could be accommodated. Even less seats if you have to wait groundside. Air conditioning is weak particularly at check in where the sun heats the facility. It is bright and clean however and some of the art work is worth a look.
Warning to O'Hare visitors. There is a group of scam artists that might approach you with a very sad story about being stuck there and needing money to get home for a funeral - sick mother - doctors appointment. This has happened to me three times in the last year. Don't give them any money! If the airport would be as diligent about these people as they are about harmless homeless people O'Hare might be more tolerable!
Arrivals absolutely terrible experience - waiting 2hrs 15 minutes in a hot and stuffy passport control queue. They only had 4 people manning the desks while the non US-Citizen queue was 500 people. Departures - dreadful sign posting when trying to move between the CTA and different terminals. Shopping facilities quite poor in the departure lounge.
For an international airport this has got to be one of the worst for lack of facilities for outgoing passengers. Immigration is great with very friendly & courteous staff who despite the long wait & heat manage to raise a smile with even the most weary passenger. The International terminal needs to update it's catering facilities both landside & airside with only a very small food court landside and a sandwich shop airside selling a few duty free items. Surely someone would have seen $ signs & created more retail outlets on both sides for such a captive market? Perhaps they should take a look at LAX or LHR & see how much money there is to be made in providing customers with better services?
Overall it is not too bad previous comments about inter terminal transfer are not quite right as the monorail runs to all terminals. Access to down town via the subway is good and quick. The biggest issue is in T5 and that is the almost absence of any decent retail outlets (food and drinks etc) either side of the gates. Like all US airports security and internal long haul to short haul domestic flights is an absolute pain that needs a goof two hours for the uneducated.
Quite the worst international airport I have ever been through. There is no direct link between the domestic terminals and the international terminal which means if you come in on an International flight you have no hope connecting unless you have at least a 3 hour wait between flights. This airport is totally unable to cope with the numbers of passengers going through it and the sooner it creates a link between the terminals where connecting passengers can go through their own security check it will get worse. I avoid this airport like the plague and pay extra to avoid it.
A warning to people who become stranded here overnight. Do yourself the favor and get a hotel. The rudest unfriendliest airport authorities will wake you up repeatedly to ask why you are there. As if I want to be there!
Transited through Chicago en route to Delhia from Philadelphia. I had 8 hours between flights enroute to Delhi so popped into town by train for a walk. It was easy cheap and convenient to take the train downtown. On my way home had a 2 hour transit between flights from Delhi and onward to Philly. No problem. Passport contol customs and rechecking my bag went smoothly. Transit between T5 and T3 was easy on the Airport Transit System. Security was a bit slow but nothing unexpected. I was through everything an at my gate with an hour spare.
"For being one of the largest and busiest airports in the United States and the world I think it would be nice for this airport to be more modern and aesthetically appealing. This airport has a nondescript ""just sort of here"" rustic utilitarian atmosphere that leaves me unimpressed. Other airports such as Houston's Bush Intercontinental Dallas-Fort Worth International Detroit and even Minneapolis-St. Paul have a more upscale look to them."
We arrived in International Terminal 5 very late due to bad weather and had missed the last flight to Denver. We were rebooked on the first flight out the next day but since it was a different airline did not receive a voucher for a hotel. We decided to rough it out for 6 hrs in T5 upon advice from a Chicago City policeman as they had a snack stand that was open 24hrs. There were quite a few of us sharing this predicament (12 total). Around 2am a group of Aviation Police waltzed thru waking everyone up demanding to know why we were there. They proceeded to 'evict' a small group of what appeared to be homeless men in a most rude manner. These men were not bothering anyone were not under the influence of anything and were quietly sleeping (I had spoken to one of the gentlemen earlier and he was most friendly). My 9 yr old daughter started to cry at the way these poor people were treated and asked me why those policemen were being so mean.
What a pit this place is. Came into Terminal 5 - zero signs for international transit and first area you show up has 1000+ people in line. Crazy. Figured out by myself there must be a different place for transit but still lines by no means short. Once through the customs little info to help on where to go to get your next flight. Finally figured T1 so train it was. Then at T1 crazy long security lineup - why did they have me leave the security zone I was in when I landed in T5 to then go back into the security zone in T1 - job making I guess as it sure is inefficient and wasted 2 hours of my time. Had 3 hours to connect and just barely made it. T1 is old and tired. Basic African airports aren't this bad and for many arriving to US for first time their initial impression is sad indeed.
Arriving international as a non US citizen is a lottery at ORD. You can be very lucky and get straight through in no time at all if your plane is the only international arrival. I have taken the evening AA flight from LHR many times and found immigration bags and customs superb. However at other times it is a nightmare. Certain times of day you have 4-5 widebodies full of Germans and Koreans and I have waited in a hot immigration line for 2 hours+. Not quite as bad as Miami or Delta at JFK but worth avoiding. Unfortunately you do not know until you get there. They open a second hall when busy and that helps but it is still horrible at wrong time and wonderful at right time. Walk from plane is not too long. The shuttle between terminals is efficient and quick (wish LHR had one) and the Hilton Hotel in the airport is very convenient for overnight connections (otherwise you need 3.5 hours minimum to guarantee international connection (which is a pain when you get through in 20 minutes).
Passed through Chicago on United flying from Rochester to Jackson Hole and back. Outward bound I was arriving and departing through Terminal 1 C Concourse. Good selection of eateries and bars. Free Wi Fi and pay for internet access if you didn't bring your laptop. Plenty of room even though this was late morning on a Friday. Returning I arrived at and departed from Terminal 1 B Concourse. I only has a short time to look around as I was making my connection. B Concourse seems much more crowded and cramped than C. Security was very very busy. I was lucky I didn't have to pass security. I can see how if one is arriving here from overseas and has to change terminals this Airport could be an absolute nightmare.
The queue for immigration was mercifully quite short and there were a number of officers on duty. Just as well because the temperature was very high and although we only had to quue for about twenty minutes it felt like bread waiting to be baked in a furnace. The luggage was on the belt as we came out of immigration. We were sharing a belt with passengers from another flight and different airline so quite a bit of confusion. The car rental sites are away from the airport so we had to wait for a courtesy bus to take us over to them. Consequently it was about an hour and a half after landing before we were on the road.
T5 has very limited facilities long narrow design means possible long walks from check in to gate. Few places to sit while waiting for check in to open if travelling internationally and the food court is very undersized and poorly located just before the TSA security check so you may have to fight your way through the long confused security queue to get in to the food court. While I was there the queue for security never diminished it ran almost to the front door with three slow moving lines. It was amusing to hear demands to have passports out - might even expire while in your hand waiting to clear security. When you get through well there are toilets but not much else the type of amenities you might find at the very end of a pier at other airports. Eat before you come in here. Signs to the city rail link the MTA are poor also from T5 yes you do go through the multi story car park en route. T3 was much better once again long walks possible here allow plenty time for any transit connection and do not rely on minimum connection times.
O'Hare has been around a long time but upgrades have kept it at the top. On my outbound flight check-in was quick and easy the lines at the security scanners were short the gate areas were large and clean with comfortable seats. The only negative is that there aren't a lot of shops or places to eat once your through the security scanners. For some reason ORD delayed our take off for 30 minutes. Coming back my flight was on time customs was a breeze but it took a long time to get my baggage.
Top Marks for Large European Family with 4 Kids. Airport was clean with hand sanitizers scattered everywhere toilets exceptionally clean. United have fantastic baggage service for passengers who have to clear customs and need to put checked luggage onto final destination. 5m from customs clearance United just grab your bag scan it and put it onto the belt. Hands down best system I've seen in a long time. Children's museum in terminal 2 is must. Its more like a play area and my four children spent 2 hours there without any sense of boredom. Could have been there much longer without worry. Traveller's Aid Centre supplied free diapers when nearby vending machine had ran out. MacDonalds in Terminal 1 had no seating area. Had to use seats at nearby gate and felt guilty about the mess my family left (ii) Immigration queues in T5 resulted in 45 minute wait. T5 duty free very poor selection compared to T1.
Arrived late from Zurich on LX resulting in a 1:45 connection which proved to be very tight. Immigration line moved quickly but baggage took nearly twenty minutes to appear on the carousel
Used this airport about two weeks ago transferring from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5. Overall a very pleasant experience the airport seemed very clean and bright. The transfer between terminals was quick and easy even in mid-day. Following advice from previous postings here I ate in Terminal 5 outside security. To my surprise the Security lines at Terminal 5 were non- existent! I wish there was a way to transfer between terminals without having to go back through security but due to the short lines as mentioned this is only a minor issue. Clear layout and signage excellent facility overall. Would recommend and will use again.
Toilets were clean. Quite easy to find your boarding gate. Waiting time for immigration clearance should be improved a little. The confusing part lies in tht the international terminal which you arrive in may not be the same terminal as where your check-in counter for your return flight is. Overall a pleasant place to be in.
I have used Chicago O'Hare numerous times for International and Domestic flights. I wanted to give this airport 4 or even 5 stars for the experience I have had of Terminals 1-3 however T5 drags it right back down. Departures: There are almost no facilities beyond security bar a few carts selling candy and cigarettes. There is no bar except for a temporary stand selling bottled beer - not exactly the way to unwind before a long flight. Before security things are a little better - you can at least get something to eat albeit at McDonalds. Arrivals: There's a long wait for bags however my destination has always been from Ireland where immigration is done before take-off so this mitigates that somewhat as we don't have to queue. There is a bar in arrivals (one might have considered putting the bar in departures?) and a shop but little else and the area is cramped with few seats. The rest of O'Hare is a pleasure but it's as if International flights are an afterthought. I understand that Chicago is a domestic hub but as an international traveller it's actually a bit of an insult.
Used T5 at O'Hare twice last week coming from and leaving to LHR. The terminal is perfect to perform a terminal's main goal - getting people quickly and efficiently off and on an airplane onto or off a cab/bus/. It took less than 10 minutes to leave the plane pick up my luggage pass immigration (being a non-US citizen) and into a cab. When leaving check-in desks are plenty and gates are only (on average) a 2 minutes walk from security gates (which are next to the check-in desks). Be aware that T5 has no eateries and only very basic duty free. Almost nothing in fact. But as said before T5 is meant to be an arrivals/departure building which works very well and not a shopping mall.
Arrived from Paris at O'Hare and everything went downhill from there. We had allowed 2 hours to connect to our flight to Calgary Canada. The plane was 30 minutes late from Paris and the immigration line is terrible. It takes forever to go through. Canadians do not require fingerprinting and photos yet we have to stand in the same line. The US residents cleared quickly but it took us 50 minutes. After that we grabbed our bags which were sitting on a non-revolving luggage carousel since we took so long and attempted to drop off our bags. All there was was United personnel yelling at people to move around to different spots and there was no queue. It shouldn't take 10 minutes to drop the bags off. Took the airport train to terminal 1. Not well thought out everything revolves around 1 escalator so people bunch up. Went through the United Priority security. Not sure why it was priority it took 20 minutes for TSA to scan 10 people. I'm sorry but it shouldn't take that long. We then had to do the run between terminal B and C. When we arrived at the gates the jetway was pulling away from the plane fortunately they put it back so we could get on. 2 hours should be sufficient. When we got to Calgary our bags and the bags of about 15 other passengers were missing. Apparently ours got hung up in TSA which doesn't have screening for transferred bags at the international terminal so they went off sight and then come back. Unfortunately ours never returned. Now we have to hope they are on the next plane and clear Canadian customs ok.
I would say that the experience varies greatly depending on the terminal you face but at least in general security wait times have dramatically improved over the past few years. United and American each have their own terminals more or less that can look somewhat grim but have a fair amount of services available. The United terminal has a tunnel that you must walk through to get to most gates (C Concourse) but at least they more or less synched together the audio warnings about reaching the end of the moving walkway. Walk to gates for American can reach 10-15 minutes if your luck is bad. Terminal 3 feels Soviet in design aesthetic but at least is being updated. Access to/from city center can be truly problematic - most hours of the day the drive (20 minutes no traffic) is at least an hour and without a car you are consigned to either an extremely overpriced (US$50) cab or an uncomfortable train ride. Delays are probably the worst aspect - part of a political game to make the traveller suffer so that Daley can get the airport expansion approved.
No problems arriving at Chcago o Hare. The immigration officer was very friendly. Queues were minimal and we got our luggage quickly. Leaving was equally problem free. Luckily we ate land side as there was almost nothing airside. Just a few stalls selling sandwiches. Is this normal or part of work being done?
Despite being one of the world's busiest airports and a hub for two major airlines O'Hare seems ill-equipped to process an influx of passengers at peak times. During the mid-afternoon international arrivals window the customs area was mobbed. Lines for US citizens moved swiftly but the processing of foreigners was glacial thanks to the multiple fingerprint scans and photographs that need to be taken. Baggage belts were also swamped with people to the point where it was difficult to elbow in and grab your own bag. Recheck was a mob scene with people becoming so frustrated at the slow service that they left their bags in a pile for the airline staff to figure out. In order to transfer to a domestic flight you need to take the airport transit system which ran so infrequently that it became dangerously overcrowded. At the terminal all passengers must squeeze onto a narrow escalator which effectively required everybody (and their rollaboard) to form a single-file line. Domestic departures proceeded more smoothly with only a minimal wait at security and an adequate number of shops and restaurants airside. One complaint about the departure areas is that many of them are too small to effectively contain the number of people when two flights board from side-by-side gates simultaneously.
It may look like a vision of hell but it got the job done. Arrived from Heathrow on Virgin Atlantic
We expected a surly welcome to America and were not disappointed. The immigration officer seemed to want to provoke an argument with his questions about why we were visiting Chicago and how we could afford to pay for our visit and with his negative comments about the city - I hope he does not apply for a post with the Tourist Board. The signage was poor for train transport to the city. The departure lounges in terminal 5 are disappointing with poor catering facilities once through security but at least the flight was on time and the baggage recovery on arrival was excellent.
It's the worst ever airport I have been to. The passport control took over 1 hour to go through having only 3 people to check International passports for thousands that were passing thru' - welcome to America! Why aren't the airlines doing something to correct this problem - they had to deal with the mess off missed flights due to poor passport control.Good luck travellers!
I've never had too many problems connecting through ORD. There are dedicated security lines for First/Business/elite FFs and those lines are never very long. At least in T3 there are a fair number of shops and restaurants to choose from and the AA Admirals Club is conveniently located between Concourses H and K so you have an easy walk to your gate. I've also never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes at immigration though granted the flight I use from DEL comes in very early in the morning when there aren't any other flights around. The main complaint I have about ORD is the utter lack of information concerning delays at least for AA flights. Flights are often shown as on-time right up to the scheduled boarding time at which point a delay magically appears with no explanation given by the ground staff. I guess they don't see the need anymore given the chronic delays that plague ORD these days. Overall though there are far worse places to transit through.
I had the misfortune to connect at O'Hare airport en route from San Jose to Copenhagen. It was my first time in Chicago and my considered impression is that O'Hare is a breathtakingly unfriendly place. From virtually the moment of disembarking where arriving and transiting passengers were prevented from leaving having to side-step high-fiving security types and obnoxious passport controls (please and thank you obviously never made it this far into the mid-West) navigating the terminals (gate M11 is in terminal 5 that's perfectly clear then) until the dingy airside international departure lounge with it's roped-shut kiosks and virtually complete lack of facilities... it was an abysmal experience.
Recently flew twice to Chicago FRA-ORD-MSN and MUC-ORD-MSN had absolutely no problems with immigration although there were other flights arrived at the same time to T5. I would say it just depends on a situation. Had no problems with re-checking my luggage for my connection flight or changing between T5 and T1. There was a queue at the T1 security check but it moved relatively fast. I consider one of the biggest ORD problems delays and changing of gates - my flight to MSN was delayed then the delay was shortened than again increased then again shortened and so on - gates were being changed three times people were going crazy. Going back to FRA and MUC respectively was nice and smooth. In general I find it very good and have no complains.
If you have time in connecting  avoid the cramped conditions and queues to eat in the domestic terminals and head for the Hilton - which can be reached by foot. Here there are a choice of a very nice Italian restaurant or a sports bar + if feeling energetic you can also access the Hilton fitness club for ten dollars and have a swim sauna or workout. It really is worth the detour if you have a couple of hours
Arrived from LHR into terminal 5 and after walking into the immigration area discovered it was virtually empty. Maybe we were just lucky or there are no other international flights arriving around this time (1315) but we were through immigration within 10 mins. Staff took fingerprints photograph and were on our way no grilling - just smiles! Flying back from O'Hare check in was smooth and efficient. As flying business class were able to use the fast track immigration queue took around 10-15 mins to pass through once airside was impressed how modern and clean the airport was. Plenty of choice for places to eat/drink duty free was rather basic but adequate. Overall a very pleassnt experience and a much better one than a visit to Orlando Intl 3 years ago.
Arriving into the US after a long transatlantic flight to be greeted by the longest looking Immigration queue of all time is not the best start to a visit to the US (four flights arriving at the same time from Asia and Europe). Non-US citizens queue took 1h 30 mins to get through and in this time the security staff walk around like prison guards checking that not a single person dare use their cellphone until after immigration. Immigration officers treat you as if you are a possible suspect with questioning and attitude not found at any other airport or country worldwide. Check-in areas are however relatively pleasant - numerous self check-in machines (for United Airlines anyway) in the US- domestic area and security not a problem if you have a Star Alliance Gold/Silver card for instance as there is an express lane for such holders which was a nice surprise. Flight expected departure time updates for both domestic and international flights was found to be largely erratic - if the flight is on-time then the gate/time info is fine but if your flight is delayed low betide if you can get any accurate info on where you should go and how long you will be waiting for. For several ORD-LHR flights that I have taken over the past few months majority have been delayed and the new departure time has almost never been provided nor has gate info. Meant that pax were wandering around not having a clue whether the flight is cancelled/delayed etc and airport customer services queues were perhaps 30 mins long if you wanted to go find out.
Now that water bottles are not allowed to be carried through security guess what has happened to the price of a bottle of water? I had to pay $2.75 for a small bottle because the water fountain adjacent to gate E8 was broken (and has been broken for quite a while). I would like to know what O'Hare airport authorities are doing about this. I am all for a market economy etc. but this is too much to pay for water! A little bit of oversight by the airport authorities would be welcome and much appreciated by travelers.
MUC-ORD-CVG. I had a satisfactory experience in ORD. From landing of the aircraft (Lufthansa) to arrival at the nice Red Carpet Lounge of United (comfy new and well equipped) in terminal 2 took me only 50 minutes. The Terminal where we arrived was relatively new yes the way from the plane to immigrations was awfully long but still shorter than in Shanghai. Immigration was efficient even if it was rush hour it took me only 15 minutes to go through. Took train to terminal 2 and after a couple of minutes I was airside. I have no complaints will consider flying through Chicago again.
"MAD-ORD with Iberia. If possible avoid Chicago airport. immigration lines for non American are simply endless and when you finally exit you will find no indication about baggage claim belt. On the contrary it is likely to find airport staff gathering suitcases in some corner or even worse taking suitcases to ""somewhere"". My baggage was completely unattended pretty far from the belt and I did not find my second baggage until 6 days later completely destroyed. Dirty old style and feeling guilty just for asking ""Where is the Madrid baggage?"" is the welcome words you will find if arriving to ORD Chicago O Hare"
"Chicago Airport may not be the most favoured hub to pass through although it's somewhat unavoidable since both United & American (both Heathrow customers...) hub there. T5 is interesting. Disembarking tired jetlagged passengers into a grey walled low-ceiling walkway is not the ideal way to say ""hey welcome to the united states"". Immigration has queues no matter what although our queuing only lasted 10 minutes. Cheerful customs greeted us with a smile which was nice after baggage claim and we dropped our bags at the United baggage transfer facility at T5. The train is harmless although initially from T5 can b a little full. T1 security is somewhat threatening. A women who sticks her hand vaguely in your direction and yelps passports (on a domestic flight) is hardly inviting and then she scribbles the gate number on our boarding cards ... it's sort of pointless... I transferred through Chicago 3 times in less than 3 weeks. The bus to E & F (United Express) gates from C (United) gates is small and not wheelchair accessable. It's a minbus with benches all facing inwards. The main C Councourse is rather attractive; it allows plenty of natural light in and allows good views of the tarmac."
Arrived mid afternoon at T5 with other aircraft. The foreigner lines at immigration were extremely long but authorities did their best to open resident gates when not in use and move overflow to other sections to reduce the delay. Took an hour to get through which considering the crowd was not too bad. INS agent polite and welcoming. Baggage already available and customs inspection minimal. United's baggage transfer can be a bit confusing for the uninitiated but mine has always turned up at my final destination so there must be a system operating. Train to Terminal 2 was quick and painless. Security here quick and efficient. Bad weather earlier in the day had caused considerable flight back up and eventual cancellations. Terminals were extremely crowded with many angry and frustrated passengers. Our United agent handled our rebooking with good grace. Next morning's checkin was a long and a little frustrating with late arriving passengers with imminent departures getting preference over those who did the right thing and turned up for their flights early. Departure gates in T2 were very crowded and obviously flights had been overbooked with constant requests for passengers with time on their hands to give up their seats for the normal compensations. Not the best airport experience but certainly not the worst.
"The airport facilities have not been re-arranged to take into account ""security"" requirements although 9-11 is several years behind us. Example: Post-office access (Terminal 2 only) is behind the security gates. Airports everywhere need to move general-use sites out of the departing-passenger-only zones; perhaps O'Hare will bear this in mind when a re-build is contemplated (and shabby as Terminals 3 and 5 are one is needed soon)."
When changing airlines through ORD the place can be a nightmare. My flight was Alaska Airlines ANC-ORD and United Xpress ORD-CAE. United and Alaska terminals are very far apart at ORD so you have to cross the street use the train to the very last terminal pick up your ticket go through security and walk down about 20 minutes to finally get to the xpress gates which is normally at the end of the United terminal. No moving sidewalk to help out. Should you find yourself changing airlines at ORD get your ticket from ORD to destination at the airport of origin. (In my case get my Alaska Airlines ticket then go to United/Canada and get the ORD-CAE ticket.) Otherwise you could be waiting in line at the ticket counter for a very long time. You will be in the same situation if you are flying to smaller airports in the northeast or southeast USA.
"I fly Internationally out of Terminal 5 at least 5 times a year and am always amazed at how bad the facilities are at International Departures. Hardly anywhere to sit - just fast food ""restaurants"" no shops to speak of. This is a golden opportunity missed! International travelers have to spend at least 2 hours in this terminal with nothing decent to eat and no stores to roam around - not even enough room to sit and wait comfortably. Once through security there is nothing at all!! The other terminals where you only have to wait 1 hour have plenty of amenities. Also bear in mind that lots of Indians and Pakistani families live in the Chicago area and when they leave the country the whole family is there to see them off so terribly overcrowded!"
I had my first travelling experience through O'Hare over the busy Christmas period. I have used Midway before and avoid O'Hare because of things people told me about it. I found O'Hare pleasant place - I landed at terminal 5 on American Airlines didn't have to do immigration as it was done in Dublin. After collecting my bags clearing customs and rechecking was out in 20 mins and in terminal 3 for my flight to Toronto 5 mins later. Nice selection of shops bars and places to eat. Fast train service between terminals.
I've flown in and out of Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports on numerous occasions and O'Hare is so much easier. On a recent KLM flight to Amsterdam I was impressed on how quickly we passed through security. Especially considering there were quite a few other airlines checking in for flights. I was disappointed however at the lack of services offered once through security. And my experiences with O'Hare customs have been pleasant no long waits. Each terminal has its own security checkpoint unlike MDW or ATL which are just a mass of people at one security checkpoint and involve long waits.
"Great architecture pleasant structure to look at. The whole place is telling ""come here again"" but as to the functionality of the venue I have to say some unpleasant words. First cleanliness of toilets is a must not facultative. Second the fact that trolleys are not allowed at the transit train between terminals makes transiting painful for passengers with bags (especially for families). Third terminals 2 and 3 are not lit enough. In the evening arrivals areas on the ground level look gloomy. Terminal 1 is not well signposted. If you fly with United and your departure terminal is #2 you have to check-in at Terminal 1 and then go to Terminal 2 through a special passage for United domestic passengers. Stupid and terribly confusing for those who fly first time. I've spent some 20 minutes in Terminal 2 trying to find United check-in desks among ones of Northwest and Continental and then somehow guessed it should be at the Terminal 1. Food I ate at the outlet near the gate (Terminal 2 airside ) was iedible. Departing from Terminal 5 on British Airways was a difficult experience. Slow check-in and nothing to eat after security at 9pm but the terminal itself is nice roomy and convenient. Arriving with united to the state-of-the-art concourse B of Terminal 1 was a great pleasure. All in all great look poor touch."
There is no way around the fact that O'Hare is simply a zoo. The facilities are simply not well equipped to handle the number of people that pass through it. Terminal 1 security is a nightmare even though there are two checkpoints one at each end of the building. Terminals 1 and 5 are also starting to look worn despite the fact that they are relatively new. That said the airport is well-maintained and relatively clean especially in light of the number of people who use the facility on a daily basis. United now needs to take a cue from Northwest Airlines (who built a new terminal facility for them and their partners at Detroit Metro) and build a new terminal at O'Hare that would allow United customers to transit from international to domestic flights in the same building.
I'd suggest avoiding O'Hare if you are trying to connect from an international flight to a domestic one. No fast track for F/J class passengers no help whatsoever with flight connections. You just wait in the queue at immigration and take your chances. It's not even logical they had space at the US immigration channel so some uniform opened the barrier for people waiting behind me to go through. One guy tried to join this from near me- probably also had a connection- but aforementioned jobsworth shooed him back. I can handle the idea of needing extra security but if you US immigration can't find a way within this to accommodate the realities of an international hub then come clean and tell people not to try connecting at this or other US airports operating on this basis- which is many of them I believe. To their credit the airport and airline staff are pretty good at managing the situation and getting you on a later flight because they are well used to this farce and ashamed of it too. I know LHR immigration is bad but at least there's an effort to get people to their connection. If this is truly where US government/immigration has arrived at post 9/11 I'm afraid you've conceded a clear victory to the terrorists on this one.
Chicago O'Hare is a mixed opinion here. International Arrivals are fantastic the most friendly INS and Customs staff I have ever encountered flying to the US. Efficient straight-forward and just plain good. International Departures is slightly less nice. Limited seating areas before check-in NO left luggage facilities even pre-9/11. Airline check-in is airy and open and makes life in the queue bearable. Almost no shops/amenities after going through security control which is a real shame. Domestic terminals are a nightmare. United's Terminal has NO information boards to tell you which terminal and which gate your flight is due to depart at staff are rude and unhelpful when you are stranded and where on earth are the information desks? On the far end of the half-mile terminal? The Skytrain makes moving from International terminal to domestic terminal easy though.
A pleasant experience. The prices are much better be it food or duty-free and the atmosphere is much more relaxed with friendly check-in staff and passport control agents. No shouting in Russian and no high-handed treatment of foreigners. Departures lounge can get crowded at peak times though and the catering options are nothing to write home about.
Nice international terminal but domestic isn't very spacious. There is a snack bar and a duty free shop in the international terminal and nothing in domestic. On way in the customs is fast longest wait I've had is 30 min. Satisfactory airport but would not want a long layover here.
Airport is a 20 km (9 miles) scenic river-side drive south of Chittagong City Center reachable by taxi or car. No local hotels or serious restaurants available within the vicinity. There are snacks and confections available in a couple of spots on the grounds side within the terminal. Renovated recently the interior is unusually modern and comfortable for a regional airport in a small country like this. The new aero-bridges serve the airport well and efficient and courteous staff make it easy to find one's way through the facility. Toilets are fair to middling but that's expected. Overall not bad at all!
Flew domestically into Chongqing on Sichuan Airlines and for some reason our aerobridge was at the small International Terminal 1. Requiring us to walk 100m around the edge of the terminal concourse and walk down stairs to a shuttle bus to carry Terminal 2 which being winter was bitterly cold especially with the doors opened while the bus waited for a full load. Once inside the proper domestic terminal it was pretty straight forward and standard routine. Once excellent feature was a lady handing out bi-lingual cards listing taxi fare prices to over a dozen destinations around the city to discourage touting and rip offs. For the return I found out the single domestic Terminal 2 is actually split into 3 separate halls A B and C. If you flight is leaving through hall C you can not enter via A or B security points. This also means you are technically shut off from the shops and facilities in the other sections too such as the McDonalds in hall A. However you are able to walk downstairs to the Arrivals level and use the transfer signage to direct you to the other areas making the segregation of the terminal areas pointless. Lastly with the security it was the only place I was asked to take my boots off beyond the X-Ray machine which all passengers were made to do. However with only one seat it meant a longer wait as you could not progress until the person in front had taken off their boots was examined and then re-laced them.
Landed at the newer of the two terminals. Baggage collection was fast and was able to buy a phone card easily on the lower Arrivals level but telephones were only on the upper Departures level. Security was tight with baggage tags checked by airport staff. No illegal taxi touts hounding you and bus into the city was quick and easy. On departing the airline waiting areas were large and comfortable. The food in some places was cheap very cheap. Same as supermarket price for bottle of Pepsi. Had a gate change but was handled quickly and easily. Efforts were made to keep me informed despite being the only foreigner on my flight. New monorail will soon open from airport to city. Airport taxi prices are not too expensive but be prepared for a wild and crazy ride.
Recent upgrades have made this airport far more international in flavor but it still has a friendly Kiwi feel. The NZ landscape scenes and birdsong in the jetways make a lovely welcome and farewell! Good view of Southern Alps from min international departure lounge. The new domestic lounge is also a nice piece of architecture. Although it handles international flights Christchurch is still a fairly compact airport and you should not anticipate long waits. Border checks on arrival may take a little longer but border staff are protecting the country from nasty bugs that could devastate NZ primary industries. Only downsides: big multi-storey car-park dominates the exterior on the city side
Small but fantastic airport very modern and clean. Terminal is easy to get around Internet is quick and many shops and dining areas present at the airport. All in all a great new airport and one of the finest in Australasia.
Arrived on a 100% full Emirates 777 (economy class) and was out of the terminal in 20 minutes. The new international departure area is the best part of the terminal with a lot of space and great views across to the snow capped mountains. The regional part of the terminal is a zoo with totally inadequate space and seating.
Jan 5 Queenstown-Christchurch Jan 8 Christchurch-Singapore. Small but lovely airport easily access to downtown with airport shuttle bus. Very efficient check-in security check immigration and baggage claim service polite and friendly airport staff food and beverages price reasonable.
"This airport has a very bad attitude to travellers who need to wait overnight. My wife and I had an early flight and could not check-in online so had to arrive at a time when it would have been pointless to book a hotel room. We were not the only ones in this situation but all of us were herded to the most draughty place in the terminal and forced to sit on uncomfortable metal seats all night even though there were more comfortable seats nearby. We could have paid to use a ""lounge"" area but on investigation this was found to be a dark dingy airless space barely more comfortable than in the terminal. A security check was carried out on all those waiting and we were issued with wristbands so restricting our comfort in this way is completely unreasonable. Some passengers tried to get some sleep laying on the floor but were woken up and forced to move by the security staff. The excuse for this? We would be safer if there was another earthquake! What spurious rubbish. Shame on you Christchurch Airport."
I travel to Christchurch probably 3 times a year. I find the airport great with a very New Zealand feel to it. Comfortable seats lovely shops in the departure lounge to pick up some memorabilia. For the size of the city it is perfect - a very relaxed feel.
I really love CHC airport after its thorough renewal basically a new airport (especially in the domestic section which was somewhat dingy before renewal). Modern clean spacious and efficient in my opinion currently the best airport in NZ (though obviously smaller than AKL).
It is hard to believe that this airport is a new design - a new design should be better than what has gone before not worse. The worst aspect of it for me was the 50 metres my elderly mother had to walk in the icy wind from the only drop-off point to reach the terminal (200 metres to International Arrivals). There is neither roof nor windbreak. Wheel chairs are available only once you reach the terminal. Have a look at Auckland: out of the car/taxi/bus - into the terminal
Arrived at airport on flight NZ 888 at about 11.25pm. I travel frequently and have used the airport before. I usually sit in the arrivals area watching TV after buying a coffee and sandwich at the cafeteria (the only venue open). I was travelling to Dunedin and was waiting for the bus that left at 6am. Last night I was ordered to leave the lounge having no where to go since the departures lounge opens only at 3am. I asked why I was not allowed to use the lounge since I was not breaking any of the written rules displayed in the airport. The tart answer from the official was that it was their airport and they decide who sits where. You can not afford to infuriate visitors to your country by having ridiculous rules and rude staff as the first point of call to an international airport.
Airport is currently under renovation. A new section of the terminal is complete and it is a vast improvement from the old building. The check-in area is spacious modern and very New Zealand. The airport is well signed. Entry and exit by vehicle to the airport is a breeze. Air New Zealand check-in area is great and not cluttered. Looking forward to when the whole renovation is complete.
Easy to park easy to walk around and find what you're after and very stress free. New terminal just opened which makes it even better. Just needs more international flights to/from the city now.
I was flying from the international terminal which had suffered some damaged in the recent earthquake. Although parts of it were closed due to damage (some food areas some waiting areas) staff were determined to put on a brave face and some asked us to e sure to return in six months when they hoped to have the damage repaired and to be operating normally. The international area is bright and welcoming there are plenty of seats and it is very spacious.
Such a vast improvement in design productivity and functionality for the domestic terminal. It's open so you can feel the change of seasons. The international terminal has been fantastic since the last revamp. Customs a breeze bio-security not too shabby. And the new themed bridges are stunning to give visitors an inside first-hand glimpse before they even get out of the airport.
Bit unfair to review in some ways as this airport is currently being re-vamped. The domestic side is in dire need of work. Small pokey and tired it will be hopefully much improved soon. The International departures area has been done and is quite good though there are not enough seats when it is busy and it is lacking in character. What a shame this pretty city did not get an airport that reflects some of it's charm?
A very clean and tidy airport with adequate amenities. Domestic and international are very open and easy to find your way around. However alo of the positive points are lost on two very odd aspects at the international terminal: firstly CHC Airport still requires the payment of departure tax at the bank outlet - airlines are not permitted to include it in their fares. Secondly the entry to customs and the departure lounge remains closed even though the airline check-ins are open and processing passengers. The result is a long queue of angry passengers waiting to clear customs when they eventually decide to open it. This is very unusual and highly annoying (as noted by previous reviewers). No reason is offered - it's as though it's just for the convenience of customs officials.
Christchurch airport is a great little airport. Very efficient and friendly staff with good amenities clean and comfortable.
Friendly Qantas check in told me that the business lounge was opposite gate 29. They did not say that the international lounge would be closed and we would have to wait outside for almost an hour with no explanation part of a growing and frustrated crowd. We watched a steady stream of staff enter via keypad each carefully avoiding eye contact with the waiting customers. One group of travellers arriving as staff entered followed to the door but were swiftly repulsed given short shrift. We were eventually admitted passed through the formalities and I made for the Qantas business lounge which I found to be closed for a further half an hour with no indication as to why. A passenger paying the business class fare has as part of the expectation free access to the appropriate business lounge this I believe I paid for when I booked with BA/Qantas why did they not say that the airport would in effect be closed to international passengers. Christchurch is a fine city but it seems to have a part time airport.
Qantas domestic is great. No line ups fast check-in and check-in staff were always friendly. Gate lounge was roomy with views out onto the airside area. Good selection of shops and eateries. There is a public viewing deck for the tarmac and planes. This was very interesting and imagine rare for international airports in this day and age. The domestic and international airports though separate are under one roof which is convenient for those landing and departing internationally and domestically at Christchurch. Just a great little airport with all the comfort of its bigger counterparts across the globe.
Christchurch is a nice little airport where you can sit and watch the planes while having something to eat. There is also a viewing deck which is unusual in these days of heightened security. I noticed a useful little play area which seemed to be keeping a lot of children happy. The airport was clean and the staff very polite and friendly.
Very compact airport with a bright new international wing. Prompt provision on bags on carousel after a Qantas domestic flight. It's also across the road (the walking route is signposted) from the Antarctic base and visitor centre which is well worth a visit if you have 2 or more hours to spare.
Not a frequent flyer but manage a trip to Oz most years. Domestic Air New Zealand area often crowded. Qantas domestic area less so. The domestic part of the terminal is quite old but has plenty of shops. It is unusual not being able to find as seat in the public areas. There is a good outdoor viewing area. The whole international terminal area is new and nice. As most flights to Oz and Singapore leave mid afternoon the check-in area can be crowded from 12.00 onwards. Buy your $25.00 departure fee coupon nice and early! The departure lounge area is all new and a pleasure. The whole airport is quite compact. You can walk from Int. arrival hall to the Domestic area in 2 minutes or so. Transport to the city is a breeze. Plenty of taxis and shuttles. Also $5.00 mini buses that go to the central city. Or take the metro airport bus for about $7.00. Buses run every 20-30 minutes and have GPS. So you can look at a display board and it will tell you when the next bus will arrive.
I have just returned back home after visiting NZ and I must say CHC Airport was a pleasure to use. It is nice and compact and people don't have to walk miles to get from A to B! The immigration staff were very polite and cheerful and there was a great duty free shop near the boarding gates. Even though there was 5 flights departing within an hour of each other to Australia and Singapore it was non chaotic and there was heaps of seating and space. Personally I felt CHC International Airport was a lot better than Auckland International Airport.
A small airport with very limited choice of shops and food outlets though generally pretty quiet. Queues are not a problem and there are plenty of staff on though some did seem to lack knowledge a bag of mine got stuck on the X-ray conveyor and the staff person did not know that the machine could be stopped let alone how to stop it!
I live in Christchurch so perhaps I am biased but I rate it as one of the best around. International arrivals is particularly pleasant especially considering New Zealand's tight bio-security systems. It's a great feeling to be back home! International economy check-in can get slow and crowded like many these days and the nearby coffee shop is too small but once in the spacious departure lounge peace and quiet rule. Domestic arrival and departure is somewhat airline dependant but luggage arrives promptly and it's no distance to transport and car parks. The drive to Christchurch must be the best start to any visit to any country.
Although it is not big by international standards Christchurch airport in New Zealand is a very nice airport. It has recently just had a major upgrade and is now a very pleasant and efficient airport with friendly staff and beautiful uncluttered facilities. Even in busy periods there never seems to be any sense of panic that one seems to get at the bigger airports. There is a very efficient and reasonably inexpensive shuttle service to the city along one of the most beautiful routes from any airport that I have ever had the pleasure of travelling on. Whilst most travellers to NZ seem to arrive in Auckland it is worth going direct to Christchurch especially if the majority of your visit is in the South Island of NZ.
A very small airport more like an airstrip. 3 airlines fly there I think: Silkair Air Pacific & National Jets. Departure and Arrival Halls are in the same building and passengers disembark and embark the plane via the stairs and tarmac. For arrival customs clearance procedures are simple fuss-free and then you wait in line to collect your baggage(s) as they are being towed in. There is a large car park outside the Arrival Hall where you can also make arrangements to loan your transport while on the island through a couple of car agencies. There is a cafe and a small gift shop inside the Departure Hall. Checking-in is done manually. The Visitor Centre may have personnel at the airport running surveys collecting opinions and comments with regard to your stay.
"I flew Frontier to Denver this time. The security screening area is new since last, but completely inadequate. Grumpy and pushy TSA agents, and lacking organization. The airport feels if they forgot to turn on the AC on this hot, muggy day in June. What a miserable experience. "
Airport security employees are the rudest and most grouchy bunch I have encountered. Dining options are very few and far between. But overall wait times are not bad.
Terrible walk ways have been broken for more than 8 months. I have flown in or out of this airport 50 times since Sept 2013. United baggage is the worst here leaving baggage unattended and office unmanned with serious delays. Carpeted floors make it difficult to push pull or drag bags. Train has extremely long waits and bathrooms do not have hooks in stalls to keep purses off the floor. With a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being best I would rate this airport a 2.
I flew on Delta Airlines to MCO and it was a great airport. The terminal was clean and beautiful it really tells about the city's history. The employees were very helpful. The lines for TSA were short and fast. This airport is slightly expensive but it is worth it. I would recommend.
I recently transferred through CVG for the first time in several years. I had forgotten just how easy it is to make connections at this airport especially on Delta flights. The terminal is spacious clean and very well- organized. And the Delta SkyClub is very nice - nicer than many of the clubs at ATL. Unfortunately the service reductions at the airport show as it was extremely empty with relatively few flights showing on the boards.
Fast and friendly service. Great terminals tram walkways and food courts. Easy to navigate with lots of information about flights.
Terminal 2 is not closed. It looks a bit dated (like it was built in the 70s well it was) but is efficient in serving its purpose. Overall a very easy airport to connect through everything is set up logically. For originating and departing traffic you can get between parking and your gate quickly even at peak departure times. TSA does a much better job here than I've seen at other airports. It's a shame Delta is in the long slow process of de- hubbing it in favor of ATL and DTW but that was inevitable post Northwest merger considering the simple geography of CVG being between the two.
CVG has been decimated by the Delta/Northwest merger. Delta has mostly moved out and the airport seems abandoned - much like Pittsburgh. It's a shame to watch this airport build up from nothing return to its modest origins. Delta's Chitauqua Airlines regional jets are now pulling up to Terminal A gates while Delta tries to put ComAir (in dreadful remote Terminal C) out of business. Terminal 2 (Star Alliance) closed altogether and I would not be surprised to see Terminal A mothballed.
CVG is an easy airport if you're not flying Delta. If you are it's still not too bad. Terminal 2 restaurants are not too bad and there is now some food inside security. A big plus. Security at this airport is usually friendly and courteous but I've had my bags screened much pickier at CVG than any other U.S. airport to the point of almost missing a flight for the same bag and contents that caused no problems at other airports. It almost seems like security personnel are bored from few flights and really like to make up for it with those that are going out. Anticipate a little extra time for CVG security. Arriving and departing at Delta terminal 3 is more like getting into any other big airport but terminal 3 food and shops are far more extensive. It's more like a small Atlanta airport but the smaller size makes it less hassle. Arriving at terminal 2 is easy
Cincinnati airport is the most wonderful airport I have connected through. The airport's A and B concourses reminded me of ATL but much wider and easier to navigate. Someone told me concourse C is closed but I went there as I had a 5 hour layover and there were several flights. This is a very nice city with a beautiful airport!
Not sure whether they changed the attitude but the custom office at my last immigration process in January was very friendly and even joked about the extended security installations aka handprint etc. I was thru in less than 5 minutes. A very good airport to enter the US. Little strange however is the extended security check right after leaving the customs area when you need to go to your gate for the next leg of the trip. The security there is a lost more restrictive than anywhere in the US not to mention Frankfurt.
Immigration and Customs were efficient and I was through both of these plus the secondary security screen in less than an hour in spite of being nowhere near the front of the plane and with another international flight deplaning at the same time. The immigration staff did all that they could to reduce delays by checking forms in the line and correcting them rather than making people go to the back of the line and fill the forms in again and directing people to the US citizen desks once these were empty. This is more than can be said at many east coast airports. The 5 1/2 hour layover passed relatively quickly as the airport had a good variety of shops and the restaurant meals I purchased were surprisingly good when compared to my usual experiences. I'll keep this airport on my shortlist as a transit point.
Still my preferred entry point into the US - as long as the international arrivals haven't all come in at once and you're on the last of them! This happened once and the queue was over an hour. Otherwise it's usually very quick and easy and spacious.
CVG is a sprawling airport with long walks from one gate to another. It's not an altogether bad place to spend a seven-hour layover which is what we did between flights from LGW and SFO. Delta Airlines Crown Club is large with many amenities -- including a business center with a goodly number of computers connected to the inernet by cable. Getting through immigration and customs is a breeze -- making Cincinnati far preferable to the most used east coast airports.
CVG is generally ok for arrival in the US. Not too busy at immigrations especially when you exit the plane first and get to the counters first. However a very foreigner unfriendly attitude from custom inspectors. On May 14 they had 5 counters for US people and only one for foreigners. Considering all the hassle aka fingerprint iris-scan etc. that foreigners have to deal with it is hard to understand why the US treats visitors so bluntly.
CVG is a good plane changeover place especially after a very long day of flying. I was flying ICN-SFO-CVG-BWI. That first ICAO is Incheon Seoul Korea. Changing planes here was simple as the airport is not crowded at night and there are a few smoke spots in the terminal namely in restaurants. No drinks to be had however.
It's been a few years since I was there but I left on a Sunday and found that I couldn't get a drink because of some Kentucky law that probably pre-dates the Civil War. Even in England we have long since relaxed our licensing hours and Sunday trading laws for main airports. I hope the same has long since happened at CVG!
Although international arrivals are a bit odd (the problem of having to re-enter the airport has been resolved) because of dual desks the airport itself is flawless. The well designed terminals make connecting a breeze between inter-airlines. I have flown in and out and have made numerous connections at Cincinnati over the past 10 years and have only had a handful of problems.
Depending on how many international flights come in you can wait 5 minutes at immigrations or one hour as I did in April. Staff was a bit 'soldier' like but ok. Immigration officer was friendly. It makes no sense to me however that once you exit immigration to board another inland plane you have to go thru security again which took another 30 minutes. Layover times in CVG should not be calculated too tight.
CVG is a better airport to connect through than Atlanta airport. The gates are laid out in a much more logical way the food and shopping is better and the Comair commuter terminal is quite nice and easy to use. The shuttle from Comair's terminal C to the other terminals is quick and easy to find and puts you in the middle of the other terminals rather than at one far end. It's a shame that DL doesn't use this hub more than ATL.
This is not a good airport for international arrivals. The only way to exit the airport is first to re-enter it. Sound confusing? Once you've cleared customs and immigration and have all your luggage you cannot exit directly to the parking lot. The only exit is through the main terminal which means you have to re-check your bags and go through security clearance and metal detectors and then find yet another baggage carousel to pick up your bags a second time. The process is excruciating and long after an international flight.
I can't believe that CVG is rated so high. I have flown through it many times on Delta and have always had problems connecting. Maybe they've improved since I was there last but the transportation system between terminals is awkward at best the waiting areas are always crowded and a couple times I had to sit on the floor while I waited for an available seat. I must admit that the ground staff I've dealt with is pleasant and helpful but in general I try to avoid CVG.
I've used Cincinnati airport twice in the past year and have found it to run smoothly and easy to navigate. The food in the main international terminal is above average for airport food the terminal is also clean and well designed. The Comair terminal is also good to use with adequate food concessions and seating.
Cincinnati is the best hub airport I have experienced in the US. Immigration on arrival for non-US citizens is efficient and polite. The Delta terminal is bright and cheerful - and the walk between gates short. I would recommend this airport.
"I have been flying into Cincinnati Int Airport for 16 years now and have seen many changes. I agree that the fares are quite expensive however compared to Chicago Dulles Houston and LAX the Airport is in wonderful condition and the staff are friendly and mostly informed. I am not endorsing this port of entry into the United States for Immigrants but they seem to be able to move crowds quicker than everywhere else I have flown into. Additionally the Airport Security is proactive in Cincinnati. They have gone through numerous ""exercises"" to ensure they are ready should an event take place. This instills my thoughts about their concerns for me the customer !"
"I was also in the Cincinnati airport on 03/16/03 and agree with the comment below. We also were flying Delta. I understand the security issue but my first day of vacation was ruined because I didn't get to my final destination until 6.5 hours later than we were supposed to. To get rerouted into Atlanta and then go to my final destination of Panama City with a 2.5 hour layover on Atlanta - we didn't book our flight through Atlanta in the first place because it was more expensive. And to have a Delta rep say to you ""well if it's any consolation this doesn't happen all the time"". I've had nothing but problems with Delta and I've flown to many different destinations and never had a problem until I started flying with them. They didn't even give any meal vouchers or portion of your money back or anything. All we got was a pony sized bottle of water t stand in a line for over 2 1/2 hours with no A/C!"
I was very disappointed with my recent travel to the Cincinnati airport on 3/16/03. On this day the airport had a security alert and everyone needed to be evacuated from the concourses and sent back through security. While this would be a difficult task for any airport Cincinnati Airport was clearly not ready for such an incident. Very little communication or direction from airport officials was provided. I spent 5 hours in a line that I didn't even know where it was going and there was no one around to ask. I spent this time in line only to find out that my flight left empty without me and that I would be unable to get onto another flight for another 24 hours. It seemed that the airlines and the airport officials were at odds with each other and neither was there to help travellers. No hotel or food was provided as a result of these delays. Very little help was provided by Delta. Furthermore no one is able to fully state what happened. Based on rumors that I had heard from other travellers the whole incident appears to be the fault of security. I would like to reiterate that this is a very difficult situation for any airport to handle. However one would expect that airport officials would have been trained to handle such a situation. This is not the first security issue to happen to a US airport of a similar nature. For these reasons I will not be using Delta or making connections through the Cincinnati airport in my future travels. Other airlines & airports I feel would have been much better at handling this situation.
Terminal 3 (Delta) at Cincinnati (CVG) has one of the most efficient open and easy to navigate terminals in the USA. This facility is comprised of three concourses
"Chaotic, no transfer facility, must clear customs and pay departure tax. 3 people on immigration for nearly 300 people, both in and out. It takes 10 minutes a person to clear immigration. If it had not been for ground staff we would have missed connection. It must have a transfer facility, if not close it!"
I used to fly into Clark regularly and preferred it to Manila. The airport was refurbished and appears new and all areas from check in through security to departure gate is fast and efficient. In 2014 there was a number of International flights including Emirates and Gulf air flying into Clark And there was a good range of domestic flights available including flights to and from manila. However after an increase in fees charged to airlines most of these flights have now ended leaving an empty unused airport which handles a few flights daily. The one remaining domestic flight to Cebu departs late evening and the terminal is deserted. This is a wonderful modern clean efficient airport that is underused as a result there is very limited terminal shopping / refreshment facilities.
Outbound to Hong Kong 13 April. I could see definite improvements at this airport since my last visit. Much quicker through immigration both outbound and inbound. More shops available and eating establishments. Keep it up!
"I recently had a 7 hour opportunity to observe Clark Airport. Clark has the makings of a good airport but attention to detail is sorely lacking. First of all there's free wifi - but only outside the airport (and maybe in Arrivals) airside you'll have to pay 800 pesos to use the VIP lounge. Airport tax as of 1 Feb is up to 600 pesos so don't spend all your local money! Then there's the bins - what bins? If you want a bin landside you'd better head to the restrooms. And while you're there bring your own toilet paper. There's no spray either. Airside (after you've paid your 600 pesos) there is toilet paper and some bins although they are few and far between. If you're downstairs where the ""cheap"" airlines leave from don't expect aircon or PA announcements. Upstairs there is aircon and PA but good luck hearing sufficiently to understand anything that's said in most announcements (Qatar Airways was the exception). So-called duty free stores are quite egregious here I saw packs of 6 beers with a normal retail value of 180-200 pesos priced at 500. News stand? Actually there was a small kiosk that at least sold a few magazines. Free drinking water? In your dreams. As for vegetarian food options - just head towards the exit keep going turn right and wait for the next jeepney back to town. Are there any good points? Well they do have seats you can stretch out on and it is reasonably bright and modern but it's not a nice place to spend any amount of time."
I used Clark for the first time recently when flying with Emirates to Dubai. On the positive - it is spacious very clean light wide check in areas smooth passport control and a comfortable departure lounge. A welcome change to the drabness and congestion of NAIA T1. On the not-so-positive - the bus service from Manila is infrequent and the Philtranco bus timetable meant I had to arrive 4 hours before departure. There is very little to keep you occupied once in the departure area with no news stands and little eating and drinking options. The only smoking lounge costs 300PHP to use although they do include coffee and small snacks in the price. Perhaps things will improve if another one or two international carriers start to operate from here as potentially it can be a much better option than MNL.
So convenient to access compared to Manila. Staff helpful and checking-in quick. You can easily see how this eventually will become the main international for Luzon being that Manila is probably the worst airport in the world. Facilities still basic but cheap with lots of building going on.
I have now used this airport twice recently. Nowadays it is busier and queuing at immigration for departures appears to be problematic at busy times. It took me some 45 minutes. The shops are adequate and the staff are friendly. Arrivals was good with proactive customs officers looking to keep queues to a minimum.
The security checkpoint setup in the main terminal is terrible. Congested too few lanes waits that require you to stand on steps. I flew through CLE two years ago and I thought then I hit the occasional bad day. Flew through yesterday was worse though not really that busy. What was really disappointing is that nothing has been done in two years to improve the situation. It's way past the time knowing these security stations are going to be a permanent requirement so Airport mgt needs to step up and get some over due renovations done. In addition the restrooms in concourse A are undersized narrow halls to get into then way too small with too few facilities. The rest rooms and security the Airport can do something about. The last comment has to do with the location of the car rental facility. Common sense would have had the facility as close to the airport as possible for customer convenience along the main road but no site selection put the at the end of a dead end street the bus passing empty acreage which would have been much more convenient.
TSA was very slow during Saturday the 9th of March - took over an hour to process us through the inspection - we made our flight by 1 minute. Spoke with TSA - I do not fly much and I did not think they were very helpful and only rude with their comments. Cleveland Airport were not prepared for the spring break travelers. The inspectors that allow you back into the country were slow - not enough agents on duty. My trip was nice except for Cleveland Airport.
Great airport! I stopped for a layover from LAX. What a difference! LAX charged $9 for a vending machine style packaged sandwich. At Cleveland I was able to get a Subway 6 inch with an orange juice for $6.39. The airport stores were all reasonably priced whereas LAX charges about 3x the average price. I was also able to get a massage while waiting for my connection. The place is clean easy to use and the people were friendly.
Nothing fancy but perfectly adequate airport. Easy transit from plane to well-labeled red line train to downtown. Easy check-in at kiosk and quick security (I should note I was flying Delta and not local hub carrier Continental which may account for short lines). Seating area at gate was full but I was able to find a seat.
A nice moderate size airport that is easy to get around and make connections. Good experience in getting bags transferred even with short turn around. VERY unfriendly to travellers with laptops phones etc. that need a charge. Just try to find a plug. Very few available. CLE is VERY behind the times and non-user friendly for electronics.
I connected at CLE whilst travelling on CO from Toronto to Kansas City. Cleveland is a great place to transfer - it is not too crowded as most planes are regional jets it doesn't have the same volume as EWR or ORD it has a great selection of destinations and it is bright and clean. There is a good selection of restaurants and cafes and the bathrooms are clean. I bet winter isn't too kind to CLE but as long as snow is not on the forecast I wouldn't hesitate to transfer in CLE again.
I don't mind the airport everything is fairly easy to navigate except trying to return my rental car. Every time I have been here I find a new way to get lost trying to find the rental car area. They could put up some better signs to direct traffic. I don't think it should take 40 minutes to go from a hotel 2 miles away to the rental car area.
Great mid-sized airport. Lots of direct flights across the US with no significant waits for check- in or security (longest I have waited is probably 10 minutes)
Flying into Cincinnai from London (or any international departure point) beats the pants off landing at JFK or in Boston Atlanta or Miami. Baggage arrives more quickly
Cleveland is a nice small airport. Getting from the gates to baggage claim is a short walk compared to bigger airports like O'Hare and LAX. This place is not even as crowded as Midway is. I flew out on a Sunday and getting through security was a breeze. I was about 10 people at the time going through but got back to Chicago-Midway and the place was crawling with people. Public transportation in and out of CLE is best by the train which takes you downtown. The amenities are decent for this airport a good selection of places to eat but nothing extravagant. This airport will not equal those like ATL ORD or bigger airports. Remember that this is a medium sized airport. Overall the airport was very clean and the signage was easy to read and understand. No problems getting in or out of CLE.
"I had a similar experience to others flying out of CLE - compact minimal facilities. If you are flying to an international destination be prepared for a major disappointment - there is no Duty Free shopping at the airport. (At least none that I was able to find.) If you are looking for a bit of peace and quiet between flights head down to the end of the ""C"" concourse and take the elevator up to the observation level (level 2). This is a very quiet glassed-in area with a wonderful view of most of the runways and concourses - too bad the outdoor section is now permanently closed."
This airport meets most needs adequately. It's not large and it does not appear to be very new. My one complaint about it is that all car rentals are located in a separate building in a galaxy far far away. A late arrival in bitter cold weather combined with waiting on the city-run rental car shuttle makes for an angry traveler.
Could be worse - pretty small (4 concourses). You could make it from 1 end to the other in about 30 min if needed. Check in is always fast and I've never waited more than 30 min. for security. Hard to pass time but they just added one of those stands to rent a portable DVD player for your trip so that helps.
Fairly compact as airports go and the gates are a reasonable walk. The most frustrating thing about this airport is the total lack of shops and eateries on the landside of security. If you want to eat you have to go through security if you want to smoke you have to go back out again to the outside. Not a bad airport for changing planes providing you don't have too much time to kill
Cluj Airport is getting better all the time. It is a fairly small airport but it is clean efficient and fairly pleasant. Expect long queues at security checks as Romanian authorities are very strict about this but staff are fine and helpful. Passport control is not a problem leaving and hardly one arriving. I have through passed Cluj Airport several times and never queued more than 10 minutes (even late at night on arrival from Munich). The duty free is small and not that interesting price wise two little overpriced cafés in the departure hall and in the international departure lounge. Domestic departure lounge is a bit small but domestic flights are only served by ATR planes. On arrival taxis are safe just walk to the official taxi rank and do not follow anyone asking you in the arrival hall - price is around 30/35 lei into town (7/8 euros). A very decent airport.
Things are improving rapidly since the last review. New terminals open and a lot more space but still a bit chaotic at times. WizzAir have introduced several new routes since they opened a base here. Beware: that the airport website is not providing real time arrivals and departures information. Beware: some over priced cowboy taxis are still lurking near the terminal. Best use the frequent and cheap bus service to City Center on main road outside the airport terminal. All in all an up and coming airport serving a vibrant city.
Cluj-Napoca International Airport is a very small airport. First thing you need to know is that it has experienced a 550% increase since 1999. But it still uses the same old terminal building. They will open 2 new terminals soon an arrivals one in April 2008 and a departures one in July 2008 so things will probably improve in a few months. But until then it's best to know what to expect if you go there. Everything is small baggage reclaim area arrivals hall check-in area (the largest of all but still small) departures hall. This means that it's quite hard for them to handle flights with many passengers. A full A320 with 180 passengers pushes the airport to its very limits. However on departure if you are there with about 1:30 hours before the departure time you're probably going to be fine. You will be queuing almost all that time (there's no real place for shopping or relaxing anyway). On arrival expect long queues for passport control. There are only 2 immigration officers processing (between them) only about 5 passengers per minute. If you're last to leave the aircraft you can expect an approximately 30 mins wait. Baggage reclaim area will be overcrowded so you'll have to wait a bit in there as well. The airport is about 8km east of the city centre and a taxi drive should take about 15-20 mins and cost approximately 15 lei (4 Euros). There is a bus stop (100m walk from the terminal) but I never used it. An overall fair experience if you know what to expect.
This airport serves both international flights to Brazil and domestic flights with Bolivia with Aerosur. The airport has average facilities for departure however it is with arrival that the weaknesses of this airport shine forth. One small baggage area with an exit for domestic travellers no customs check required and one exit for international travellers with a through customs check result in chaos. The lack of baggage carts and hundreds of people struggling with several large suitcases each all struggling towards the one international exit result in a rugby scrum. When I arrived the one customs agent controlling the gate was also checking the other domestic arrivals gate. I only escaped after throwing my luggage out of the surging crowd and then dragging it back to the luggage area and eventually out. What should have taken 10 minutes took one hour.
Quick tips: When you're flying in carry a pen. Both customs and immigration forms are required but your airline may not provide you with both. When you're flying out (especially international) make sure to arrive as early as possible during peak season. If you're flying outside of the main tourist season you'll be okay if you arrive within the time recommended by your airline otherwise make sure to give yourself an extra hour or so. Be as courteous as possible do not act entitled and be careful when questioning the authority of airport officials. This is generally a good guideline for flying anywhere in India. People working at the airport will be happy to return the gesture if you go out of your way to show them some kindness. Arriving in India for the first time can be pretty stressful but I've seen the process become downright awful countless times as other westerners get held up because they acted contentiously at a checkpoint. If it takes you 90 minutes to get into Kochi you need a new driver. Granted Kochi is big but without traffic it takes only 20-30 minutes to get to Lulu Mall which is in Edappally.
As stated in other reviews the airport is clean and reasonably efficient compared to other airports in India. When we had a flight from the domestic terminal in February the queues for early morning departures were quite long. Both passengers and staff were tolerant and all passengers were eventually processed. Duty free is virtually non- existent especially in early morning when very little was open. A small but busy airport and one of the better ones to fly from in southern India. The main negative is the distance from Cochin a drive of at least 90 mins. We stayed at an airport hotel for an early flight and were glad we had done so.
Very clean and efficient airport. Immigration officials are friendly. Not very big duty free. Best airport in Kerala you can visit.
Small busy efficient airport. I have been through many airports around the world and just like every-other airport Cochin has its own character. You will face the typical cynical laid back atmosphere and character of Kerala. The quality of service and amenities offered at this airport comparing to the economical status is extremely satisfactory. Keep a warm confident and positive smile on you and enjoy Cochin.
Small efficient and clean airport. Arrival was smooth it took no more than 30 minutes to go through passport control and collect my luggage. On the way home check in was quick. There was a seating area with soft chairs away from the gate if you had a long wait.
I travelled more than 20 hours from Sydney Australia to Kerala and did not have a pleasant experience at Kochi airport. Having forgotten to bring a pen along with me I searched all desks at the immigration area for a pen but in vain. I asked an official and instead of handing me the one in his pocket he directed me all the way across the hall to a desk with a lady sitting behind it. When I asked her for a pen she suggested I go look at the desks and when told that there were no pens there started arguing with me until in frustration I grabbed one from her desk. And when I complained at the immigration desk the officer laughed it off and asked me to carry one in my hand bag. Waiting times and cleanliness was acceptable but service and attitude of officials was atrocious.
I was flying Jet Airways to Mumbai to catch my flight to Munich with Lufthansa. Two officers checking the same document 2 times before you even check in with the airline. Another luggage scan to be performed before you check in your baggage. After check in you go through security. Men and women have separate lines. This is where I encountered the most incredibly rude security staff. Even Mumbai Airport staff were better than here. Just the attitude of that person ruined the whole impression about the place. I suggest the airport authorities should give some customer service training to these staff before they are put to work. Wi- fi did not work but rest of the staff was acceptable.
Me and my wife flew from and back JFK-Abu Dhabi-Cochin. The immigration officers are not customer friendly and fast enough to absorb the number of passengers. While coming back to USA it was difficult to find the departure gate entry because of overcrowding by general public. Somebody control the crowd for the convenience of passengers. The CISF personnel at just before the security/scanning check was very rude. Too many checks at different stages which is not found in Gulf or American airports.
Small but clean airport. Things move reasonably fast with not much hassle. Duty free options are limited but the prices are reasonable. Adequate food and beverage services. Immigration officers could do with a smile on their faces.
I flew out of Cochin to Doha on Qatar Airways. QA told me to arrive at the airport 45 minutes ahead of flight time as I was flying business class. Fortunately I arrived more than 2 hours ahead which turned out to be barely enough time. On arrival at 6.30 am there was a huge slowly-moving line just to get in the international terminal. Two uniformed guards were slowly checking every boarding pass and passport. Just inside the door was an identical performance with another guard checking the same documents! As expected QA check-in was flawless. Immigration involved a slow line. At security everyone needed a body scan. The departure lounge when reached was surprisingly large and clean -- which was needed to recover from the entry process.
I flew in from JFK via New Delhi and then to Cochin. It took about 45 minutes for the luggage to arrive we were the only arriving flight in the middle of the night. I had to go the rest room its dirty and the floor had water all over. The domestic side of the airport is severely lacking with regards to facilities and cleanliness.
Surprised by the efficiency and friendliness of all personnel - immigration customs airline check-in and duty-free staff were uniformly courteous on arrival and departure. The toilets were clean. Departure lounge seemed spacious but that may have been because ours was the only international flight at the time.
Clean and neat terminal. Immigration department needs to increase their staff. Departure lounge is big clean quiet and facing onto the runway also comfortable seating arrangements. Big parking area with flowers and plants. Large duty free shop area with reasonable price. Staff all seemed smiling and friendly. Overall very good experience.
Flew in from KUL with AirAsia into Cochin airport. At the immigration counter the immigration guy even had a sense of humor. Once out of immigration and down to baggage hall there was a duty free for incoming passengers. After collecting bags arrived outside and there were no hordes of people asking for your attention. In fact no one approached us - we quietly queued for a taxi service (at the official counter) the driver came near the arrivals and took us to the taxi. Its a wonderful airport without hassles that are normally associated with travelling in India.
Very clean spacious terminal. There was increased security with screening prior to entry into the terminal that took about 10-15 minutes. Once in the International Terminal baggage screening check-in emigration and security was all completed in less than 30 minutes. The departure lounge is comparable to any international terminal in aesthetics quite spacious quiet with five gates/aerobridges wall-to-ceiling glass facing the tarmac and runway and very comfortable seating with good snack outlets at a reasonable price and a large duty-free area. Staff all over the airport seemed very friendly with the sole exception of the security at the entrance who were more curt and to the point. Overall a pleasant and relaxing experience.
A clean modern airport but managed by incompetents. It took 2.5hrs from entering the airport to getting into the departure lounge. Increased security is the excuse but it does boil down to very bad management. Massive queues in the initial security re luggage (45 minutes)  check in with Qatar was fairly quick (15 minutes) followed by very slow moving long queues at immigration control with staff working at a snail's pace ( 60 minutes) followed by personal and hand luggage security checks (30 minutes which involved manual tick sheets where each passenger had to be marked off involving 3 staff collectively looking down a list. As a frequent traveller I see many airports and this has to be the slowest and most badly managed airports.
Check-In. I was heading out on Qatar Airways to Doha and was asked by the carrier to report 4 hours in advance because of 'heightened security'. I will go to the grave wondering why they ever did that. Because since my flight was at 5 am I reached the airport at 1 am. The check-in counter was not opened till 2.30 am. Yes 1.5 hours spent sitting at the limited seating in front of check-in. Immigration - for an airport that has maybe 7-8 international flights leaving in a span of 3 hours in the early morning there are four immigration queues. The wait was endless and the x-ray screening process was confusing. I put my carry-on bags in one queue and then have to go for through a metal scanner two rows down. I don't get it: If you operate a process 7 days a week 52 weeks a year - doesn't it occur to anyone involved that there might be a better way.
Surprisingly big clean modern terminal but getting through it was a joke. From arrival at the airport to first clearing baggage screening then check-in immigration customs security and further odd checks took an hour and a half. Our flight to Dubai was delayed half an hour simply because other passengers were stuck in the bottleneck.
Flew in and out of Cochin on domestic services. Considering this is the 'new' airport it was looking pretty shabby and the facilities are minimal. There's the usual stream of military-looking personnel checking passports tickets baggage labels(!) multiple times and for goodness sake go to the toilet before you exit the terminal - as they won't let you back in again. It is also worth mentioning that the airport is 45km outside Cochin so leave plenty of time to get to and from it.
Flew in and out of the domestic terminal on a recent trip to Kerala. I was expecting better given that it's a privately run airport. The facilities on offer are almost non existent - just a couple of shops before the check-in area but nothing beyond check-in except for a Cafe Coffee Day. The airport also seems rather small given the high amount of tourist traffic to Kerala these days
I have flown in an out of Cochin airport around three times now (1 domestic and 2 international) and have been lucky to make it out of the airport within 10 minutes of leaving the flight. I agree with other reviews that it would help to have some foresight in their planning as the facilities seem too small for an airport that is already having the fourth largest passenger volume in India and looks to attract further international flights. The shopping options are at best a joke and could be done without. I would have like more information screens giving an updated status on all flights in the waiting areas. I wonder if the designers even looked at any comparable international airports for good designs. My rating - 3 stars - and a lot of areas to improve.
For a small Indian airport was surprised at the high standards. Having a major upgrade so scaffolding about. Public toilets clean and tidy. Lounge on left on entry is a joke but good coffee and toast. BTW economy pax can get in for free if they have a Gold Mastercard - no charge.
Departed around 10 p.m. and found check-in area devoid of any crowds. Then proceeded to coffee shop at left of check-in area which also doubles as lounge for a number of airlines (incl. Emirates). I doubt whether this establishment will still be in business on my next trip. They never served alcohol in the past but now they have even stopped serving soft drinks (cola lemonade). However they do serve Red Bull - go figure. They charge Rs 240 (around US$ 6) for a cheese sandwich - outrageous in a country such as India. Duty Free Shop prices are in US$ but no flights depart from here to US. If you elect to pay in a currency of any destination country (e.g. UAE Dirhams) they will overcharge you on the exchange rate and then again by not having small change. Total premium: 15%. On the upside: waiting time at immigration has improved but when exiting India your patience is sorely tried by the extensive scrutiny that Indian travel documents are apparently subjected to.
I wonder if Guy Liardet went through the same airport as I did? It was a shambles. Check-in was fine but the problems arose at baggage screening and immigration. It took an hour to clear those two obstacles as the security guard could not recognize two books in my suitcase and I therefore had to open my case and in the next queue airport staff were not checking that departing passengers had completed their exit slips for immigration and as a result many had to fill them in in front of the immigration officers meaning that it took 5 minutes to see two people. So by the time security had been cleared we had to go straight to boarding. No time for lounges duty free or anything.
Clean and well run if a bit spartan. Airside lounge very comfortable some catering. Both gender toilets clean and well maintained. There were however seven or eight administrative hurdles (X-ray this X-ray that boarding card emigration stamp this customs stamp that check again) to cross.
Cochin Airport is definitely in a higher league than any other airport in India. For amount of traffic handled the layout and size is more than adequate. Still not as efficient as it could be though. The desk placed in front of the security area was staffed by 5 people but only one was actually doing any work (checking boarding passes) whilst the other four were clearly not engaged in productive activity. I would have preferred to see what for Indian conditions is a whopping airport tax of Rs 500 (collected in cash and on top of the various taxes already charged to your ticket) being used to provide a wireless LAN instead of overstaffing by a factor of 5.
"Cochin though the principal business center of the very small south Indian state of Kerala is hardly a grand city. I remember well the old naval station that served as Cochin's past airport. The new airport is leaps and bounds better and given the humble nature of its surroundings a marvel. Compared to other Indian airports this is undoubtably one of the best in the country. I have found service to be clean efficient and relatively friendly. Is this Changi or Heathrow or Hong Kong - no. Is Cochin in the same league with these places - no. Is the shopping great - no. Who goes to a Kerala airport to shop? (Although I bought a bottle of Grand Marnier there at an excellent price.) I must say that many European and American airports I have travelled through haven't the same charm as this small outpost. The seating in the waiting area though ""auditorium style"" is among the most classy I have seen in any airport and RS500 (~USD 11 only for international flights outbound) is not much for an international traveller."
This airport was opened a few years ago as India's first privately financed airport so when I went to Kerala a few weeks ago  I had expected to find a highly efficient and modern airport on a par with Singapore's Changi or KLIA. The terminal looks drab and antiquated and is already showing signs of poor maintenance. Facilities and shopping opportunities are very basic. When I landed there were only 4 immigration counters open and the small holding bay was absolutely packed with just one flight
Inbound was'nt too bad with immigration completed quickly- but then we were at the front of the queue and those behind had a very long wait with only 3 staff working. Outbound was poor - not much attention paid to security- none of the usual questions etc  but all the bags were x- rayed. The worst aspect is the lack of any catering after immigration- you can buy a coffee but thats it!!! For an early morning flight we were starving and could have done with something a bit more. Beware of the unexpected R500 (cash only) airport charge which you dont find out about until you're checking in and all of your Indian Money is spent.
I have used Cochin aiport three times now. As expressed by other people the airport serves its purpose with no foresight and a vision for the future. The immigration and customers check take ages to complete. Why can't we Indians build more space and money into our mindset.
I have flown in and out of the new Cochin Airport many times in the last few years. Even though this airport is cleaner compared those of Bombay and Delhi I find the amenities to be very basic. This airport is far below the international standards and I am sad to see the lack of vision by planners of this airport. The sitting area is so clustered you will feel that you are sitting in a big auditorium.
I flew in and out of Cochin airport (Nov '03 & Jan '04) and found it to a clean friendly (even the security people had smiles) and efficient. A nice surprise after Bombay Delhi and Calcutta airports. If you're going to Kerala I definitely would consider Cochin as an arrival point.
Started with just 1 international airline and 1 domestic airline three years back its now serving 10 international airlines and 2 domestic airlines with a traffic of 250 flights per week. A new terminal complex coming up with all the latest stuff. This airport is dream come true for all the people from a tiny state called Kerala.
I recently flew into and out of Cochin airport India. There has been much hype about this airport as I understand that it is India's only private airport. The facilities are very basic and regretfully woefully small. It has the trademarks of Indian planning with absolutely no foresight. This much hyped up airport will be outdated and outgrown within the next two years. Typical of other airports in India. The Check In areas are small and so is the Customs and Immigration areas. I flew out on a Silkair A320 and still had to wait for 20 minutes at the security gate queue. Its a pity the CIAL has gone the AAI way.
Functional adequate satisfactory are descriptions that come to mind. Unlikely to offend but not memorable.
It's big enough for the number of people it serves on a weekday although I'd imagine it would get pretty crowded when the larger Virgin planes come in from Melbourne on weekends. The staff are friendly the facilities adequate for a regional airport of this size the queues managable and it's clean. It just feels like it's missing something. Despite it being refurbished within the last decade or so it feels like it needs a bit of a touch up-and the constant use of that sickly blue colour everywhere doesn't necessarily help the situation. So yes it is a nice airport in regional NSW that serves its purpose and the needs of the people but I just get the feeling that with a bit of money put in (new floorings lick of paint open up the departure lounge a bit more provide wi-fi) it could be have a certain wow factor reserved for NSW regional airports like Newcastle Albury and Dubbo which have been thrust forward into the 21st Century.
In my opinion airport is not at all up to the mark. Only one aerobridge 2 duty free shop No internet facilities 1 eating outlet. Needs to improve a lot.
This airport is of a very low standard. The baggage delivery is very very slow and not enough departure gates (only two gates are there right now). On the whole this is one of the worst airport in India.
Its a pity - the city of Coimbatore is growing fast at the global level and yet the airport does not cater to international flights except for the meagre Sharjah flight . Yes it is neat and tidy but it is also getting a bit cramped. The Government at the Centre and State could look into Coimbatore as a potential for international flights. The private domestic airlines had success when they were offered permission to fly there. I feel if foreign airlines are given permission to do so they will meet with success too. In domestic flights Indian airlines did not show much regard to suitable travel times to and from Coimbatore In the international side Air India has not shown any interest at all. I feel they think it would be a loss for them to fly there. So since they are not going to lose out on anything foreign airlines or other private airlines of India could be given permission to fly to Coimbatore on international routes.
The airport is tiny! Too many passengers use this airport. The potential of this City is enormous! Government needs to show some care for Coimbatore.
Contrary to what I had expected to find at a small domestic airport the terminal was beautifully clean well laid out with the benefit of some shops friendly staff who helped us through the security and check- in process. Ladies toilets (both Indian and Western style) were acceptably clean. A/C was okay if you were standing under it. I would have no hesitation in travelling through this airport again on future visits to India. Well done to those who maintain the Airport - keep up the good work.
"We flew to Antalya with tuifly and arrived at Cologne/Bonn by train. The way to the Check-in Counter in Terminal 2 was easy to find and also very short. We appreciate that the Terminal was not crowded, clean and bright. We made a little stop at McDonalds where we found a playzone for our kids. The big panorama windows allow them to watch the aircrafts on the aprons and a little playground with a plane and a slide shorten our waiting time. It was an enjoyable atmosphere and a very good start in our holiday."
Enjoyed my trip to Mallorca with AB and CGN's Terminal 2 with its modern architecture. The check-in was hassle- free. The stuff were helpful and friendly. There was no queue at security! The waiting time was entertaining because of free wifi and the selection of restaurants and shops. The connection with S-Bahn line S13 to Cologne central station is okay. Every 20 minutes travel time 15 minutes EUR 280 one-way.
Great new T1 refurbishment completed. Light airy new flooring clean pleasant! Super fast security check with open minded and friendly and smiling personnel!
Terminal 1 is huge for a medium city. Terminal 2 is much more light and airy but I have only seen it from the tarmac. T1 Baggage claim is the worst signposted among all the airports I've been. You have to search through two long lines of shops for the exit. Evidently they want your last dime before you leave. On arrival the train station is quite far. You have to walk all through the horseshoe shaped terminal building to the opposite edge then down the stairs to the train platform and up to the ticket office. S13-S12 lines are a very fast and cheap way to reach downtown Cologne and back. T1 is spotless as you may expect but it's a bit dark before security. The age of the building is more evident airside especially at the gates. If you are headed to a non-shengen country do not cross passport control too early because after there are really no thrills.
This airport is unreliable in winter as it can't handle light snow. Got held hostage in waiting aircraft for 2.5 hrs following repeated de-icing repeatedly closed runway and broken down snow clearing vehicle on runway.
Probably my favourite airport in Europe. Security lines usually short to non-existent (although Monday mornings can take 10-20 minutes on a bad day). Free wi-fi throughout the airport a bonus. Arriving very pleasant too with immigration normally taking less than 5 minutes. Typically takes me less time to get from plane to car with checked luggage at CGN than it does to get out of London Heathrow or Gatwick with hand luggage. If departing from CGN late evening (or are delayed) there aren't a lot of shops or facilities open past 8pm.
Probably the quickest and friendliest border control in EU baggage arrives quickly easy to use and navigate through and friendly efficient staff. Very pleasant experience.
I have used Terminal 1 at CGN many times over the last few years and with one recent exception I have generally had good experiences. Terminal 1 has an open airy feel to it and it manages to have a good range of shops and eating places without giving the impression that retail is more important than aviation. Surface transport links are excellent although signage can be a little hit or miss - my first attempt to find the bus to Bonn ended in the car rental area. Most recently inbound from EDI border control was painless with a welcoming smile from the officer at the counter. Baggage wasn't the quickest but it was still acceptable and I was on my way within 30 mins of landing. Outbound to MUC a few days later check in with 4U was a breeze I had time for a bite to eat and a visit to the Besucherterasse. However things were spoiled when I went through security. It wasn't busy so there were no significant delays but the staff who dealt with me were brusque to the point of unpleasantness. I'm an experienced flyer reasonably competent in German and not readily upset by airport staff but on this occasion their attitude was poor. CGN is a decent airport and could be a really good one if it wasn't let down like this.
I travelled from Cologne-Edinburgh from the new Terminal 2. Its very clean spacious and a masterpiece to look at. The security clearances are very strict which is a very good sign for security and safety. The only disappointed thing is that there is hardly any cafes once past the passport clearance in gates 30-31.
As efficient as you would expect for a German establishment and spotlessly clean. Decent facilities the only downside being that the queues at food and drink outlets were extensive although admittedly it was the evening rush hour. Overall I would rate it as between 'good' and 'excellent'.
Arriving from EDI. Positives the passport check (I am not a EU citizen) was perfunctory and the baggage arrived quickly. Negatives - the bus to Bonn is not signposted and its frequency is useless by German standards (every half-hour) - in trying to get a ticket for it I ended up being sold a rail ticket that wasn't what I needed
Marvellously laid out quick and easy access from the terminal to public transportation excellent directional signage throughout the terminals and one of my favorite European airports.
What a pleasure to use a smart clean airport
This is an efficient small airport. There are good connections within Europe and some long haul scheduled flights (but not enough). The security process is relatively quick as is immigration. The restaurant facilities are limited but satisfactory. The transport to Cologne by train is fast but the bus link to Bonn although rapid is only every half-hour and has been reduced in frequency - a mistake that needs to be rectified. Still taking everything in consideration it is much more pleasant and user friendly to travel through Cologne/Bonn Airport than it is through a big airport like Frankfurt.
Arrival at airport through railway station convenient but no automatic doors to leave station
Overall spacious and clean airport. Cheapest long-term parking P3 was full. Obviously not an incident because there was a staff member to advise about other possibilities present. Had to choose between queuing or going to P2. Travelling by GermanWings was outside Schengen which meant departing by bus from a (temporary?) big party tent connected to the Terminal 1 building. Very hot because of the sun on the roof. Passport control on return also in a tent. Bagage reclaim big enough (now?) no problems there. Picking up co-passengers after collecting the car from the parking turned out to be a big problem at least for Terminal 1. The natural place to wait seems only accessible for taxi's and the like. Advice: collect them from the departures level where they can wait on a visible spot.
At CGN Germanwings use their own terminal 1 which they only share with LH. Arrivals: Passport control and baggage reclaim in Terminal 1 old outdated and extremely small. Once outside you can actually start enjoying the airport especially when you reach T2. Very nice layout spacious lots of shops bars etc all in glass very modern. Connection on the train to the city centre easy to find and use. Regular service at very good price. Departures: From train station very long way to walk and not very good signposted. Once in actual terminal it all changes. Germanwings' check in area very big and spacious it was fairly busy yet it didn't look chaotic. If travelling with hand luggage it is possible to use self service check in which is easy to use. Security very quick and polite. Shopping good for the size of the terminal. If travelling outside Schengen my advice wait to go to your gate until last minute as once you clear immigration there is no shops or bars. No airbridges in terminal 2. Departures side of airport is very modern spacious clean good sign posted very nice to use. They need to do something about arrivals tho as it is not very nice and gives wrong impression. There is also a small viewing area on top of the terminal which is free and gives good overview of the airport.
CGN is a pleasant small airport. It reminded me of BRS except that CGN used a jetway BRS didn't. Train connection is kind of weird. I wanted to use my free luggage trolley to the train door which means using the elevators which never are easy in any airport. The elevators in CGN are hard to find and the buttons are really confusing with the labels not clear and worn off: I ended up on the wrong floor several times in the terminal and in the train station I ended up on the wrong side of the tracks. The train ticket machine wouldn't read my VISA bank card so I had to go back through the terminal and crazy elevators to find an ATM machine which did work to give me cash to use in the train machines. When I arrived in the Cologne Main Train Station the same type of machine accepted my bank card with no problem and a train staffer was there to help also. Also flying out be aware that you can't get into Burger King on the other side of security. The only normal place to eat is Subway and the attendants there ignored me so then I went over by the Continental gate for a German place for Cappucinno and Crescent which was okay. Otherwise just a handful of shops and not much else so just remember that it really is just a small airport. The security seemed okay but the security staff doesn't speak English and there's no fast line for guests who know what they are doing but otherwise no real problem. (I have a metal medical implant and am too familiar with security in many airports.) Okay that's all. Probably comparable to HHN (which I've used many times) but maybe better because of rail link and closeness to an actual city.
I used this airport in December 2006. It is a small airport with only very limited facilities especially on the departure floor after security. I also find that it is rather poorly sing-posted. It took me a while to locate the train station from the arrival at Terminal One. On the way back I had to take a long detour from the train station to the Terminal building. I was shocked with the smoking arrangement. There were numerous anouncement to inform passengers that smoking is only allowed at the cafes and the bars. Surely these should be the last place it should be allowed.
Pretty good airport here mainly used for low-cost carriers such as HLX- Express and Air Berlin. Good range of facilities my only gripe is the wait between getting off the plane and baggage reclaim but otherwise a very good airport with all the facilities you need.
May 2006. Well designed calm and spacious airport with a fair range of shops / eating options for the size of the place. Rapid connection to Cologne Main station and then onto the rest of Germany by rail. Only one criticism - exiting the station on the way back I did a very long detour because the signs were not too clear but it gave me the chance to have a look around this pleasant airport.
Good airport following major infrastructural investments. Extremely easy to get around with numerous new shops being added recently. New transatlantic flights starting in May (Continental to Newark) and with the airport's great emphasis on low cost segment big future ahead.
"Cologne airport is one of my favourites whether it's the shiny ultra- modern new terminal or the 1960s ""old"" one which has a cool retro appeal of its own. If you're into architecture you'll enjoy it here. Staff are mostly friendly and chatty the atmosphere is calm and spacious and a good tip is it's got one of the cheapest duty free shops I have found in Europe (whiskey bargains to be had!) what's more at the ""old"" terminal you can walk into the little duty free and buy on LANDING which means if you're coming from the UK and wanting to bring your German friends an alcoholic gift it's by far the best place to pick it up and there never seems to be a queue. Only downside I can think of is that you need to be ready to walk long distances through its large spaces especially if you land at the old terminal and then want to get the bus into Cologne. However the S-Bahn link to the main station has recently been completed it's cheap and quick and at the end of the line lies one of Germany's best and friendliest cities."
Cologne/Bonn really has developed within the last years. When I was young the airport served only a few European destinations and was mainly used for inner-german LH flights. Nowadays CGN is expanding rapidly since the no-frills carriers Germanwings and HLX moved in. The new Terminal 2 is a very nice steel/glass construction with a large departure hall and a lot of shops and cafés. Although Terminal 1 is more than 30 years old it still has a relaxed and cozy atmosphere. However restoration will be necessary in the future for sure. A weak point is the public transport system. At the moment passengers have to take busses either from Cologne or Bonn to get to the airport and back. A new railway station is under construction and will be opened on June 23rd 2004. I hope this will make the airport even more attractive as I really like flying out of CGN.
The time was 3.30 am but the departures queues were fairly long. I benefited from having reserved my seat online. My main complaint is that the prices in all shops and restaurants are in $US. The prices even for a coffee are 3x the price outside.
Flew to Frankfurt with Sri Lankan and the check in was fast and simple. The airport itself doesn't facilitate many products available for passengers to use. Besides the Palm strip restaurant and the few coffee outlets there is nothing else. Duty free is very limited. Terminals however were very clean and the staff work valiantly to keep it clean. Arrival itself is a complete contrast. from clearing immigration till the point of customs you are surrounded by people shouting orders and is honestly one of the noisiest experiences ever. The staff are rude as they can possibly be. The airport is in need of serious improvements!
"The worst airport experience of my life! I had to change flight here travelling from Rome to Male and on the departure day I had to wait about 8 hours. Dirty restrooms dirty floors dirty seats just a few shops to spend the time bad prices. Low quality food at the Palm Strip restaurant and in the end no one among the airport workers able to tell us where to find a lounge with an entrance fee to pay. We received so many different bits of information and were directed to four different ones all with no allowed access. On the day of the flight back to Italy due to a long delay we went to the SriLankan travel assistance desk and received a coupon for a meal. Again extremely bad quality at the Palm Strip restaurant where we had to ""choose"" among 3 dishes. Definitely the worst airport I've ever seen."
Colombo Airport is in no way of international standard. The main area is a long corridor with very limited seats and on both sides of this corridor are the boarding gates. The interiors are very old and in shabby condition. The check-in counters are limited in numbers but they are never too crowded as the airport receives very limited number of flights and its main airline SriLankan Airlines too has limited flights. The immigration counters are also limited in numbers and the behaviour of immigration officers are pathetic. To me they seemed lethargic in their work and very callous in their attitude. There are very few eating joints and couldn't find a single international chain (KFC/McDonald/Burger King). There were only a few SriLankan restaurants serving SriLankan local food. It was surprising to see the very few duty free shops but a large number of shops selling kitchen and household items. The outside of the airport was very chaotic. No separate lanes for taxi/private cars or buses. All were in same lane.
This is probably the worst airport we have ever been to. The interior was old and dingy. The people there were very unfriendly and didn't help us at all. We had a layover for more than 6 hours. We tried to find a restaurant and nobody could help us. Once we found the restaurant the food was terrible. Only good thing was that the prices for food and drinks were cheap. We didn't find a place where we could actually rest. Air conditioning was rare. Mosquitoes everywhere! We actually had to wear sweatshirts although it was unbearable hot! Thanks. Not again!
Easy to navigate paying for a porter is the best advice as they will get you through quickly to the check in desk. 2 lots of security scans luckily it was very quiet when we arrived at 1130. Airport has a few shops but prices cheaper in the UK. Serendib lounge closed for renovations so had to use the Araliya Vip Lounge (travelling British Airways Club World) clean but very basic tears in the leather seats and not what you would expect! OK for a cold drink and a cake! Clean toilets.
Was in Colombo Airport for a flight to Delhi. The terminal is quite small and based on my observations receives much less traffic than regional rivals like Delhi and Mumbai. Checking in and immigration was pleasant with queues being very short. Ground staff did take some time to check us in but were friendly and immigration was fast and efficient. However the main problem with this airport are the facilities and cleanliness. There are no major international food stalls such as Mcdonalds KFC etc. There is only one small food stall area which offers a limited menu. There are very few shops which all sell the same souvenirs. There is also limited seating and the toilets were not that clean. Not a bad airport but should try and improve a lot if they want to compete with other south Asian airports like Karachi Mumbai and Delhi.
"While I've got no qualms about their in-flight service or the entertainment system (since I mostly spend the time sleeping) I'd rather take a kayak back to Europe than have to deal with their ground staff once again. Unfortunately my company made that decision for me and bought the tickets with SriLankan a few times so far so I've had the displeasure of having to deal with their check in staff a few times in the past. I'm no stranger to their total lack of co-operation regarding anything at all but their most recent fad is just beyond belief - they flat out refuse to check your baggage to your final destination. Apparently they want you to buy your connecting tickets for subsequent flights directly from them in order to be able to use this 'service' that all airlines with an ounce of common sense provide everyone. In other words pay double what you'd pay normally to SriLankan Airlines have your baggage checked! Long story short they wouldn't check my baggage to the final destination and were being very rude about it (""no exceptions for foreigners!"" the staff simply turning around and pretending not to hear my question about why this ridiculous policy is in effect generally exuding an extremely rude attitude they kept me at the check in for so long because of this I nearly missed the flight etc.). I've been to dozens of countries over the past 10 years and never once had to endure what these people put people through at Colombo International Airport."
A reasonably good airport there are some works going on in the departures area but they aren't causing significant problems. They need to sign board better trying to find the toilets was not easy!
Airport was really good a variety of shops and duty free range was good and quite cheap. Security strict which is good.
Much better than I had expected. Overall cleanliness was reasonable signage good and the aircon worked. Food and drink was decent once airside with adequate comfy seating. The check-in experience though was a total nightmare.
A truly unpleasant airport in every sense. Wash rooms are dirty and smell appalling. Staff are remarkably rude. Very little cleaning is done and although the airport is only a few years old there is filth everywhere - seats with stains dirt in every corner. Getting a taxi from the airport means getting treated rudely by airport personnel. No facilities not a proper shop no adequate refreshments available no comfort. I will try to avoid visiting Colombo again.
Having travelled through Colombo 4 times in the last couple of months I can say it is one of the better airports in the sub-continent which is faint praise indeed. The air-conditioning is anaemic the restrooms are only marginally acceptable the duty-free area in the arrivals hall is more like a bazaar with various traders vying for your attention. The drop-off area is over-crowded with people and with vehicles belching diesel fumes. Check- in is a nightmare with long lines and clueless ground staff. On the plus side the terminal is clean and well lit and less crowded past immigration and easy to navigate. Sadly the alterations and additions are very mediocre and the elegance of the original terminal with its colourful fabric ceiling have been long lost.
The problem with this airport is that it is well away from Colombo the only road can be very busy and therefore you need to arrive well ahead of time. Getting into the building takes a long time because of the security. The problem here is that non-travellers try to get into the terminal which is not allowed (except with a permit) and so the security guy at the entrance checks your passport and asks for your ticket. With e- tickets there is no need to carry any documentation and so this causes a little bit of unpleasantness. Once past security all baggage is x-rayed which is fair enough but there is only one machine. There is a lot of queue jumping. Once past that hurdle the next one is trying to get to check-in. If you arrived early you will have to hang around until the check-in opens. Once past check-in things do get better. Immigration staff are generally courteous and immigration is painless. Once airside there is one reasonable but overpriced restaurant. Service is slow. If flights get delayed do expect chaos with the lovely but clueless hostesses. It is very easy to get into the wrong area as gate staff are pre-occupied. This is the only International airport in Sri Lanka at the time of writing and therefore I have no choice but to recommend it but with reservations.
The last time I came through Columbo Airport I gave it a pretty good review sadly things seem to have deteriorated - either that or the airport is struggling to keep up with increased passenger traffic. Flying into the airport isn't too bad although the pick-up point for arrivals is now as big a shambles as the drop off zone for departing passengers. Departures is a different story. Apart from the scrum at the aforementioned drop off point the check in desks are partitioned off from the rest of the departure hall and you're not allowed to proceed to check in until instructed to do so. Fair enough but the amount of seating in the departure hall is completely inadequate for the number of passengers waiting for their check in desk to open. Also there is only one channel through the partition and when check in for a particular flight opens this is immediately mobbed by the waiting passengers with no attempt by the authorities at managing the process or – heaven forbid – organizing a queue. Once airside things do improve but since passengers have already gone through full security screening at a) entry to the departure hall and b) entry to the check in area why is there a need for a third security check at the gate itself? Still not a bad airport but the management ought to think about making the departures process less painful for passengers.
"The management of this airport obviously believes that ""queuing is good for you"". Try to depart from here in the early hours and you are met with an obstructed main entrance to the departure area where you first have to pass your luggage through x-ray machines. Then you get to the departure hall which is separated from the check-in area by - you guessed it - more x-ray machines. Perversely only one x-ray machine was working when I flew out so the queue was horrendous and completely disorganized. Surely this could be easy to handle particularly now that visitors to Sri Lanka who previously obtained an entry stamp in their passports now have to pay for a visa on arrival. Where is that money going? Another annoying feature of this airport are immigration officials who are clearly chatting away to friends or family on their mobiles while on duty behind the immigration desks."
Colombo to Heathrow check-in was appalling. We had checked in online and only needed to drop our baggage. Arrived in plenty of time however we were in the online check-in queue for 1 3/4 hours! Poor management queue jumping passengers not having checked in online group members appearing from all over the place. When through sheer frustration I complained there was a total look of surprise from an attendant overseeing everything - but doing nothing. It would have been quicker not to have checked in online. Needless to say I only had 15 mins to shop. Also whilst there may be many 'checks' several passengers were able to get water onboard without it being removed.
Excellent airport however the government officials such as immigration and customs are very rude. Long queue at the initial baggage screening. No ATM inside terminal.
Found the new addition to the airport very clean and spacious. The airport is not very large and easy to navigate. The staff are friendly and willing to help. Great shopping in the Duty Free.
We travelled from Colombo to Abu Dhabi yesterday. On arriving at the airport we were asked for our details and why we had visited Sri Lanka etc and we were pleased with the security in force on entrance to the Airport. However once through to check in this turned into a nightmare. It was nothing but unorganised chaos. We could not check in on arrival maybe we were too early no reason given and we could not understand what was called out and information given on the airport tannoy system could not be understood or even heard. Volume was far too low. People checking in after us were not forming queues but were cluttering up the area and making it impossible for people to check in easily when their flight was called. We have travelled all over the world first time to Colombo and the lack of organisation or any queuing system made it the worst checking in experience ever. It was not until a lady joined the officials on duty that any progress for checking in was made. We were at this airport for 4.5 hours and found it to be the worst system in the world. Once through this area to check in baggage it was acceptable.
"My worst airport experience in more than 2 decades of frequent travelling! First of all  all vehicles approaching the airport are stopped by a guard who exercises a ""face-control"" - looks at the passenger and asks him his nationality. Any credible answer seems to be accepted since no documents are verified - I repeated 3times mine but the guard had never heard of such an exotic country called Greece - but let me through! At the entrance of the terminal queue for luggage screening -once inside 60 minutes queue for check-in then the gate changes 3 times! What is the point of having recently revamped the shopping area ?"
It has got its act together pretty well I think. Everything clean in the terminal. Business lounge okay staff great. Don't change much money here as not a good rate. Check in a bit chaotic but not bad. Good onward travel to Colombo Kandy (by taxi not tuk-tuk!)
A pleasant surprise the airport now has air bridges connected to a modern pier. This in turn leads to the first floor of an expanded main terminal in which arriving / departing passengers mix freely. There were several immigration desks open even though it was 3.30am and I was processed quickly and efficiently. Baggage reclaim took a long time - bags were added to the carousel painfully slowly and it took about 45 minutes to recover my two suitcases. Once through customs there were several currency exchanges - don't bother comparing rates they're all the same! Departure on the 14th â€“ nothing much has changed since I was last here. The drop off zone is small and chaotic with passengers having to (try to) queue up outside to get through the limited number of security / baggage screening lanes immediately inside. Once through security and into the terminal things are a lot more efficient although CMB remains one of those peculiar airports where the check in area is partitioned off from the rest of the departures hall and passengers are not allowed to proceed until the check in desks for their flights open. Fortunately there was sufficient seating while I waited. Once checked in and through emigration the airside section was spacious and comfortable if somewhat eccentrically laid out. For the most part the airport is by the standards of developing countries clean efficient and pleasant - I've been through worse airports in wealthier countries.
Fairly smooth arrival and departure both in the middle of the night. Found a functioning ATM which worked and the arrivals info desk arranged a prepaid taxi for us. We took a local bus late at night for our departure
My wife and I visited Sri Lanka 12 in January 2010 and found the airport generally very good on all counts apart from a large cafeteria type restaurant in the departure lounge which served some of the worst coffee I have had for a long time.
Used this airport for departure on 30 Jan with a flight at midnight. What a zoo! Far too few entrance doors for the large number of pax to even get inside the terminal. Immigration a discrace for a country trying to attract tourists - with three or four wide-bodied flights departing around the same time only six immigration desk were open. Next organizational gaffe: CX and EK departures scheduled within 10 minutes of each other from neighbouring gates 8 and 9 with a shared security checkpoint. Our flight delayed by more than one hour due to this horrendous circus.
Small modern clean airport. Has a fair amount of shops for its size slightly overpriced however not the ideal airport for a transit more than 1-3 hours. Take use of their stopover package which allows you to go out to spend time at the beach or to explore Colombo city though I think its available only for SriLankan Airlines passengers. Overall nice airport has the potential for so much more.
I use Colombo often as transit airport Frankfurt-Singapore and cannot say anything bad. Airport is overall clean easy to find the ways and gates restaurant area is ok the transit desk is working well.
I must have been lucky because both arrival and departure on a recent trip to Colombo was very smooth. New procedures have been introduced to monitor swine flu with immigration officials sporting white masks - as soon as you pass through to arrivals all the locals are sneezing without any care! The security checks are still very much in evidence and with a constant military cordon around the airport. I was though able to be picked up and dropped off directly outside the terminal building. The airport has recently been modernised and has the benefit of the usual shops and restaurants - what I didn't like was the fact that the toilet attendants hover and expect tips and that once through the final security checks there is no access to the toilets from the gate area. Annoyingly because of the archaic Sri Lankan currency regulations everything is priced in $US
I flew to CMB from Doha and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the airport. I was through immigration and out of the airport in less than 30 minutes. The touts are numerous and best avoided. Outbound check-in area was nice and spacious. The duty free shops and restaurants are plentiful and toilet facilities clean. Overall CMB is a small yet modern airport.
Colombo Airport now has plenty of shops at the departure and arrival lounge. BIA needs more expansion and an expressway is underway.
Well the nightmare described by a contributor below has not improved - far from it. Somewhere within the mad bureaucracy a new scheme has been devised for departing passengers. You may now not be driven to the airport terminal by friends/associates. Instead they must drop you off about 500 metres ahead of the terminal where you are transferred to a rickety bus without A/C. How this is supposed to improve security (the officially stated reason) is beyond me - but it does provide additional income for touts who pounce on passenger's luggage and lift it into the buses. On the upside arrivals are quite smooth but that is to be expected at an airport with hardly any traffic worth mentioning.
The inbound is OK but be prepared for a total nightmare on leaving the country. Before you arrive at the airport you join a long bus queue to have your Passport checked. Then you disembark the coach and are met with a huge throng of friends and relatives seeing off one person. Then your ticket and passport is checked again before you get into the building. 10 feet further in all your luggage goes through X-ray scanners and you are subjected to a full personal body frisk. And I do mean full. Genital areas too. These soldiers are also wearing filthy gloves that have done the same thing to hundreds of others before you. Absolutely disgusting. Then you will probably have to open your case because none of the young soldiers/airmen know what simple equipment is. A camera battery for example. In a camera. I even had a Cuban cigar taken out of its tube and handled. All the time you are holding up the queus of people behind you. Then it's off to the check in desks down a short corridor to another ticket check point and luggage check. All this before you have even got to check in. I totally agree with Andrew here. I've travelled through most of the airports in the world and I have never ever seen one as bad as this. It makes Homeland Security look like amateurs. It's a fairly nice country but nobody has any idea of what they are doing.
Modern construction and airbridges good shopping in departure including souvenirs garments tea etc. Plenty of seats and restaurants. Plenty of check-in counters and baggage carousels for collection. Taxi and forex conversion counters in arrivals. Immigration very slow and careless and not very co-operative or friendly immigration staff. My passport was stamped with the previous day's date when my flight arrived at 4AM the staff were so callous not to even bother changing the date on the stamp!
New terminal building is a vast improvement on the old once. Good facilities air bridges and a reasonable number of shops. Immigration can be slow (as with many things in Sri Lanka). Leave plenty of time to get through security and immigration when leaving Colombo. There is only one ATM (cash machine) at the airport. On the day of my arrival it was out of order. So take some cash or travellers cheques. There are plenty of banks just outside the arrivals hall where you can change to Sri Lankan rupees. If you need a local SIM there is a Dialog shop just after the banks (near the hotel stands on the left). A local SIM costs Rs 1600 with Rs 1000 credit). Activation takes 2-3 hours.
What a dreadful experience! Heathrow/Colombo/Bangkok and return. The outbound wasn't too bad but that was probably due to the arrival time of our flight at Colombo the immigration process took about 40 minutes but the return was a nightmare. Our flight arrived at about 1000pm and seemed to coincide with the arrival of several other flights - six or seven hundred passengers at immigration and about twelve desks but only four were being used that's about 150 passengers per desk after queing for over an hour the immigration official serving the queue that we were waiting in decided that he had had enough and cleared off - we were then told to join the back of one of other three queues. Another hour and a half wait and it was our turn my wife got processed but when it came to my turn the official decided that he was thirsty and was going for a drink. I tried telling the official that we were together but that fell on deaf ears and again we were told to join the back of one of the two remaining queues. Pandemonium broke loose airport security then stepped in and began screaming at passengers - almost immediately two more desks were opened but that just made matters worse. Never again. The security people were treating the passengers as though we were animals I appreciate that there are big security issues in Sri Lanka but our experience was totally unacceptable.
The airport is clean and modern duty free shops are good and the staff polite and helpful. Check-in takes a lot of time due to the many security checks.
I have used COS airport several times flying from Nashville to COS and back to Nashville. Each time I have been there airport personnel have been very helpful and friendly TSA security officials have been efficient and very observant and the airport has always been clean. I would highly recommend this airport to other fliers.
The lack of reasonably priced and convenient public transportation options to and from the airport is a major downside to this otherwise attractive airport. Why the city bus system stops just short of the airport is hard to understand without invoking a conspiracy theory involving the expensive and inconvenient commercial bus taxi and limousine services that enjoy a monopoly in this market.
I highly recommend traveling out of COS if you live in Pueblo Colorado Springs even Denver! COS is a very cozy and convenient airport with easy parking check-in security and baggage claim. It's main terminal has 12 gates so it isn't at all huge but it is a very comfortable size. In the past several years the planes flying into and out of COS have sadly gotten smaller (think regional jets) and the routes served are mostly to hub cities. That said I would personally rather fly out of COS and connect than drive the extra hour and a half to DEN and fly nonstop because it is a lot less stressful. The airport recently purchased new furniture for each gate area and it is a vast improvement. They even have padded benchs in the center of the terminal that you can lie on and sleep before you fly! This little extra is great because let's face it when people come from sea level to 6187 ft it is nice to lie down and adjust to the high altitude. That said one downfall of COS is its lack of shops and restaurants though the variety isn't horrible. The free Wi-Fi throughout the terminal though helps compensate for this shortfall.
If you don't need to go to Denver I recommend COS as the best option for going to Colorado. Small but not too small
I fly through COS whenever possible even though I live in downtown Denver. Very nice clean simple airport. If you're flying on United the walk to the gates at the far end (the entire terminal is half the size of DIA's Concourse A) takes about 10 minutes). Security is quick and painless parking is plentiful and cheap and the concessions are good. The only problem I've ever had at COS is nothing to do with the airport itself
COS is a nice airport and very efficient. Restaurants are good for a smaller airport and baggage claim wait was short. I really appreciated the free wi-fi internet service something that is often paid for in other airports. The only drawbacks are that it is far from the city so cab fares are high (plus the city bus system doesn't include the airport) and the terminal is so tiny compared to the airport as a whole that it takes a long time to taxi to the runway even with light traffic.
This is a small airport so you will never get lost. I go there twice a year and have never been held up going through security for more than five minutes. The staff have always been very helpful. For such a small airport there are a few decent places to eat. I used to fly into Denver and drive to the Springs but never again.
Dirty airport with very few direct choices. Always have to connect and always late. Not sure why nay major company would relocate to Columbus knowing that they have a sub par airport.
Easy and pleasant smaller airport. It has all facilities required for a pleasant wait is spacious and never crowded. No wait times at security and very friendly people.
Overall pleasant to fly in and out of. The facility has gone through a major renovation some time ago and it is still well maintained. Most parts including the restrooms are very clean. The main terminal is not so big but not too small to be overcrowded either. The parking garage is attached to the main terminal so travelers can avoid being exposed to the wind/rain/sunlight to reach their cars. A McDonald's is located within the airport complex. The landside and the 3 concourses are also fairly well laid out and dotted with decent number of eateries. In most cases the check-in and security check procedures altogether took only about 10 minutes for me and as the terminal is not too big even walking to the farthest gate takes only about 5 minutes. Of course TSA agents sometimes can be less than courteous. Baggage handling was fairly quick I did not really have to wait for more than 5 minutes until my bags were placed on the carousel for pickup. This airport offers free wi-fi and plenty of power outlets in between seats including USB power ports. My only concern about this facility is the lack of public transportation options. This airport is connected to the city by only two bus lines (52 and 92). Of course as this airport is only about 15 minutes' drive from downtown even a taxi ride costs only about $25 which implies a low demand of public transportation options in this region. Nevertheless I sometimes just feel insecure about the lack of public transits from any airport and this airport is no exception to that.
Easy access. The airport is not crowded and very short wait if any. Signs were easy to follow and everything is laid out in a practical manner. There is free WiFi all over too so that's a plus. There's a decent amount of restaurant options too despite the size of the place. I also applaud the quick baggage handling and also the helpfulness of the workers in helping you find any misplaced baggage.
Major enhancements have been done to CMH airport. The airport is well organized and has good selection of restaurants. We hope to have a direct connection to Europe sometime next year.
rather cold and impersonal although food shop and check-in staff pleasant and I was able to check-in over an hour before departure. Extraordinary use of loud-speaker systems inside and outside the terminal playing a local radio station at full blast. It seems this airport is owned by the local radio station so loudspeakers are used to blast their advertisements at you as you alight from the (Regional Express) aircraft. Beware that the terminal is shut until about an hour or so before an aircraft arrives or departs and one is forced to look for shelter where one can if dropped off a little early. Strange place.
"It has become increasingly crowded over the years, there are plans for terminal expansion to remedy this problem, but it is unclear whether this will be completed during the foreseeable future. The restaurants are pricey, but Copenhagen is a pricey city, and most big city airports overcharge captive passengers airside. There are other problems and it is annoying for me to be set in the middle of the duty-free immediately upon passing security without the possibility of avoiding it. It gives a mercenary touch to what was, before the duty-free shops were moved to their present position, a pleasantly laid-back, but high-service airport. Not everyone wants to buy alcohol, tobacco, perfume and chocolate, and if one is in a hurry to make a flight that is far out on one of the concourses, the duty-free shops are a nuisance. The absence of seating in the transit halls is also a problem, which others have noted. Worst of all was the slow baggage handling. It took me at least 15 minutes to get from the aircraft to Baggage Claim, and when I arrived, an electronic sign informed us that there would be a 25 minute wait for our flight's baggage to arrive - a total of 40 minutes since the aircraft arrived. However since another flight's luggage was scheduled to arrive at the same time and was given priority, adding an additional 15 minutes before the first piece of baggage from my flight plopped onto the carousel. That made the wait for baggage 1 hour 5 minutes. Add 12 minutes for my bag to arrive, my total wait was 1 hour 17 minutes! Things were not always this way, and I am sorry that what once was my favorite airport has fallen this far. On the positive side, passport control for EU and non-EU residents was efficient and painless. Also positive are the various direct connections between the airport and center city - regional train, Metro, and the 5A bus, all either in the terminal or directly outside and, with the exception of the bus, all offering a rapid connection. Also, while many or most shops and eateries at Copenhagen Airport are exorbitantly expensive, there is a shop in Terminal 2 that offers items such as umbrellas, headphones, pastilles, and small personal items at a most reasonable price. Also, a few of the shops offer wares that are priced no higher than they would be outside the airport. This may be small consolation to travelers on a tight budget, but with 25% VAT, there is no way of escaping the fact that Denmark is an expensive country. As for queuing times at security, I have had both good and rotten luck in the recent past. I shall see what conditions are like on my return trip in 3 weeks."
I spent some 100 minutes at CPH during a transit stop last week. It's full of shops and there are plenty of eating options. The one thing which amazed me (positively) was there was no security check for passengers changing planes especially those going between schengen and non schengen services. Yes they check passports but no scan of hand luggage or passengers. Unusual in this day and age. It means you can buy water at your first airport and still take it onto the second flight which is helpful. Not sure if this is the norm but it made the transit process much quicker.
We used this airport for both arrival and departure and found it to be a relatively small but cozy airport as compared to other European airports. Overall the airport is clean with the exception of restrooms - restrooms were not dirty but there were not very clean either. It is easy to navigate in the airport with brightly colored signs in both English and Danish. It also has a fine number of restaurants and snack bars offering all kinds of meals - fruit / juice bar sandwiches hot food - and not to forget the cafes with Danish coffee and pastries! The baggage claim is on the first floor where there are also currency exchange counters. After the baggage claim one can take the bus (outside the airport) or the train (in the basement) that provides services to Copenhagen Central Station that in-turn provides service to must of Europe - it is very convenient to use public transportation to and from this airport. The duty free shops have a fair collection of merchandise and the prices are reasonable. I would use this airport again!
At first sight a nice airport but once you see beyond the veneer you realise it's designed for the retailer not the passenger. Lots of shops but very few seats before passport control. Once through passport control no organisation or facilities outside gate so everyone in a huddle standing or seated on floor waiting for gate to open at which point mass crowd. Ryanair might not be friendly but at least they are normally efficiently organised. Oh and no announcements of delays and once in gate departure area can't see screens. Good job I checked online!
CPH worked very efficiently on my recent visit although I can see what people mean about the long distances you have to walk. Be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to get to your gate if you're arriving at the airport on the train especially if you're departure is from anywhere other than terminal 3. Security was busy but relatively quick. Loads of facilities airside but pricey.
I have been flying in and out of this airport to visit Copenhagen. The Terminal was quite clean upon arrival it was easy to find the exit and the railway station and the airport has a good connection to the local public transport. When flying back home the check-in area was crowded but it didn't take long to drop the bags anyways. There are lots of shops and restaurants inside the security area and one can perfectly observe the traffic outside from the big windows in the gate areas.
"Check-in is poor. Even if checked-in online and baggage labels printed you end up waiting in queue to drop the baggage. Security is normally OK but quite often with delays. Most of the terminal area is like a shopping center without proper facilities for just waiting/relaxing without having to spend money. Departing/arriving via the ""F"" gates is a disgrace and proves that customer service just doesn't exist in Kastrup. Always queues at immigration and endless walking both at departure and arrival for no purpose except to annoy passengers."
Waited 40 minutes in the queue before security and this was a Tuesday at 10.45. After security one enters directly into a tax free shop - rather irritating and a problem if you're in a hurry. Toilets far between the one visited was filthy and badly smelling. Prices for food and drink are too much - I had to pay $11 for a cup of coffee. All other prices double of any other place in Copenhagen. The airport looks nice but with inefficient security staff filthy bathrooms and prices above the skies it's better to avoid it.
Transited through CPH routing BUD-LGW. I had high expectations of this airport after hearing about it being a '4 star airport' and it being in Scandinavia but I was bitterly disappointed. The lack of seating is just completely unacceptable! There are shops here the size of main department store shops and they are just one after another. The number of food options is also excessive. Seems the airport just wants you to spend as much money as possible and forget about the seating. It didn't even seem that busy when I was here and there were people sitting on the floor.. One of the poorest airports I've been to and definitely the worst airport in Scandinavia. CPH managers - take a look at ARN and you'll learn a lot!
"Queue for 50+ minutes to even get to the security check even though the active signs are saying ""queuing time 21 minutes"" - far too few staff. I guess they had a rush of people turning up unexpectedly for all the scheduled flights? Lucky not to miss flight."
"Advertisement on posters States ""the world best security service"" this should be changed to ""the worlds slowest security service"" there are a bit of humiliation involved when standing in line for a long long time when only half or less security points are operating it's crazy. The posters about the world leading service only makes it worse. Also Copenhagen airport is the slowest in getting baggage. Often you will enter baggage arrivals hall with the message of 25 min to luggage arrival this is bad."
Huge queues at security with about a third of the lanes firmly shut even though it claims best security in the world. And only two passport windows open which is a bit rubbish too. The wifi wouldn't let me register. They are not as good as they like to think they are.
It feels a bit crowded and rather packed. Therefore the overall clarity of the infrastructure suffers. I'm also not too fond of the food and beverage selection. Copenhagen Airport could attract more restaurants/shops that offer healthy foods instead of burger sandwiches and hot dogs only. Prices are exaggerated. Furthermore there seemed to be issues with the baggage handling. I waited 20min for my suitcase upon arrival.
Everything seems to work at this airport. Check in is easy and you are informed about the waiting time through customs and baggage control. There are plenty of restaurants catering for most and I just find the airport being user friendly.
"Disappointing experience. Very long unassisted walk from and to ""F"" gates in Terminal 2 an unacceptable 45 minutes queuing for Security. Understaffed passport check points resulted in further long queues - leaving very little time in the overpriced shopping mall that appears to be this airport's most attractive facility!"
The time in the airport was fine but my complaint is the price of 2 coffees and 1 muffin at Starbucks which was 117 Kroner or £13.There was a billboard outside the unit advertising a deal for coffee and a Danish pastry but apparently this deal finished at 11.am. This must be the most expensive coffee in Europe.
This complaint is specifically about the business lounge facilities (or rather the lack of) at Terminal 3. Firstly the choice of food is miserable in fact the worst in any business lounge I have ever been to the world over. There is a lack of seating with powerpoints and suitable desks for doing laptop work. The wifi also has low spots about the lounge so I had to wander around trying to find good signal where there was a seat available. When you pay huge sums of money for business class so you can do business when travelling this is totally unacceptable.
Staff are friendly but the facilities are terrible. There is not nearly enough seating - people just sit on the floor. Restrooms are marginally clean. I was unable to access wifi. And everything is quite expensive.
We were stranded here overnight because of the storm and we waited about 4 hours to be rebooked by which time there were no more hotels. We were given blankets pillows and water as well as meal vouchers. The staff were very helpful and friendly despite passengers kicking off. Airport facilities are great even if quite expensive- but that's more to do with Danish prices generally. Floors are not comfy and the seating could do with a revamp. Free unlimited wifi was a godsend.
I wish they would give free wifi like Oslo. Stockholm and other passenger friendly airports do. Instead they greedily want to force you to sign up for their advertising. I did not fall for their consumer trap. I highly dislike the airport for this arrogant unenlightened policy. They have the cheek to claim that they are thinking of the best for passengers. This lack of wifi ruined my stay there. Happily I am now at Stockholm airport so I can use their good free wifi offer to complain! Finally when will airports give us water fountains. Or is it about selling water bottles? When will they begin charging for toilets and breathing the air?
"Not an international airport as laughably marketed. Staff don't show up until 5.00 at the earliest and anyone checking in for an early flight that has been booked via a third party will have to wait until two hours before departure to check in. Denmark thinks the entire world relies on online check-in - still unavailable to many. 7/11 is the only available option in Terminal 2. Staff highly regulated by the typically officious Danish Trade Unions who restrict hours and the petty Scandinavian obsession with ""Green"" policies means you cannot fly until after 5.30 in the morning. If you have been to a real international airport before this one will disappoint. Toilets are passably clean and the wifi is good - so this place will please the most anal of travellers but as a flight hub - forget it. Denmark boasts about being ""The World's Best Society"" - with the zero smiles rudeness and cold atmosphere drunken loud early morning folk and not much fun for passengers. In Europe it's Heathrow every time as the only sensible hub if you are after common sense and a little more than the one coffee shop on offer here. Vienna a far better hub for example. Security queuing times a disaster area. Seating for the endless queues of passengers waiting for the staff to turn up to work non-existent. Copenhagen airport remains the world's most over-hyped airport. You could not make it up."
I have traveled extensively for business and leisure and this is the worst airport I have come across. Security staff are rude and aggressive. I spend a lot of time preparing for screening including removing my hearing aids. Despite this I was given search by a man who would not accept that I could not hear him. I was treated like a criminal for having a plastic comb and handkerchiefs in my pocket. Baggage handing is poor and carousel a very long walk from the plane. In general there are very long walks at both arrival and departure. Seating is poor and prices very high. I will not fly to Denmark again after this.
I have passed CPH twice last month and found nothing to point fingers at despite peak season: spotless easy check-in security fast and staff smiling and joking lounges 25% crowded (29/7 - Servissair) which is absolutely acceptable. Fast immigration/disembarkation procedures (1 minute waiting each way). Prices exorbitant (like in many other airports). A/C working well quiet except in gate areas. Good view and fast transfers and taxi'ing as the airport is small - but modern. I like CPH.
Expensive crowded airport that is clearly past it's prime. Lounges are busy and crowded to the point that the whole idea of lounge and quiet area with privacy has flown out the window Restaurants are extremely expensive and frankly do not offer value for money. Baggage handling system and quality of employees assures that more often than not bags do not connect even if there is an hour or more between flights. Unfortunately I transit Copenhagen a minimum of twice a month some times up to 4 times I cannot recommend this airport for a transit stop. If you travel to and from Nordic countries try Oslo Helsinki Stockholm and Keflavik.
"I travel monthly in Europe United States and Asia. But nowhere in the world have I encountered such drastic measures as at ""security"" of Copenhagen airport. Some of my toiletries were confiscated not because they exceeded the 100ml containers but because they didn't fit in their sealed 1liter thin plastic bag. I do travel with many creams since I have a skin condition and need them. I have been traveling since 2001 with a thicker plastic bag that is a bit larger than 1 litre. This was the only airport security in the world that didn't allow me to travel with my plastic bag. They treated me like a criminal for bringing 4 small 25ml containers more than allowed - not being able to fit in their sealed plastic bag. It must be sealed they said. The security guard thinks militaristically. Rules are rules and none can be bent under any circumstances. A travesty of security as if I were a threat."
An intra-Schengen transit was painless. The facilities were good and I found plentiful seating with good views though I did have to walk a little way from the gate I arrived at and departed from (which were adjacent). I had a snack that was expensive - more so as I did not have any Krone. Generally though a good experience for me.
I passed through CPH early on the morning of June 29th 2013 on my way to London from Wroclaw. First impressions are of a clean airy terminal building. Pros: Walking around the departures area even early on a Saturday morning there was a good variety of food available. No problem navigation around the airport to my departure at D101. Cons: Toilets need an overhaul. Though all flush and tap controls are operated via infrared the surrounding walls looks tired and dirty. Prices for anything are extremely expensive even compared to LHR.
Departure: excellent. Clean calm efficient and lovely. Good mixture of shopping and food. Light and modern. Great experience. Arriving: passport control nice and easy but sometimes not enough staff. Baggage claim is terrible. Always takes forever for luggage to arrive after a flight.
"Almost no seating at all in the departure areas. In one area the only seating was some square blocks of granite. Most people had to sit on the floor. In another area there was a few (but not enough) chairs and they were really cheap. I've never been in a worse airport. As an aside make sure you know in advance that this is a ""silent airport"" (no announcements of boarding). You just look at the sign above the gate then watch the crowds rush up."
The last 2 times I have flown through Copenhagen they have shown that they are completely unable to handle the inevitable problems that occur. The first time I had to go from Copenhagen to Sweden and on to Helsinki. The flight was so late that they knew I would be stranded in Sweden but still I had to complain to get them to move me to a later flight which was direct to Helsinki. 2 weeks later I was due on the 17.10 flight from Copenhagen to Helsinki. They first said it was expected to leave at 17.15 then at 17.15 they said 18.15 and they continued in this fashion all the while the passengers had nowhere to sit (no gate offered and all seating is at the gates) so passengers ended up stood in front of the information board for hours. Staff don't do you any favours without complaining so at 17.20 I got them to change me to 18.45 flight to Helsinki (they admitted it hadn't even taken off from Helsinki). However they didn't change the luggage (despite there being 1.5 hours in between my changing to the flight and the flight leaving). Consequently I had to file a lost baggage claim in Helsinki and received it the next day. If you are unlucky enough to have to fly through Copenhagen be aware they will try to down play any problems so that you don't try to get them to change flights and they do not care if you are inconvenienced (even if you are stranded in another airport).
I use Copenhagen airport roughly once a month. Passengers are in my opinion well served in this modern up-to-date airport. The airport has over the years developed improved passenger 'self-service' which speeds up the process of getting to your gate. The latest development is scanning machines just before security. These automated gates allow entry on reading your boarding card much the same as the London Underground ticket gates. The next improvement due in 2013 (which I'm looking forward to) is 'self-service baggage drop' where passengers can simply drop off their bags without standing in those endless snaking lines. To start with eight self-service bag drops will be opened in Terminal 3 and four in Terminal 2 and the service will initially only be available to passengers flying SAS and Norwegian.
Surprised no one else mentions lack of seating. Very few seats between security and other side of gate. Space all taken up with shops and paying restaurants. Gate only opened 30 minutes before take off and could finally find a proper seating area. Otherwise airport worked efficiently day we were there.
Went through this airport a week ago because of a connecting flight. I just had hand luggage but I noticed that passengers with baggage could pick up their baggage from the conveyor belt some 12 minutes after arrival. Instructions about baggage and the right conveyor belt were clear and accurate. It was easy to navigate through the airport. Staff were very friendly. SAS airline staff at the airport was polite and helpful as they helped me check in (I lost my reservation number on the previous flight so I couldn't use the machine to check in). Security check went ok and fast. Everyone was pleasant. I didn't like the fact that airport gives you only 15 min of free wifi. There is no recharge point and you can find a power plug only in some restaurants and cafes which are far too expensive and do not accept diners card and can't return cash in euros. The exchange office was very far away. No automatic ones. Still found some friendly employees in one café that let me use a power plug for free. Boarding was ok. The waiting area is a bit dull though. Had no problems finding my way to the gate because signs are very clear.
I travel frequently to Copenhagen with two small children to visit family and despite the nice shops and interior this is eaily the worst airport I have ever been to with kids. As the only airport I have ever encountered staff do not allow through security small foldable buggies built for airport travel. They claim the union wont allow staff to carry them down the stairs by the aircraft. Travelling as a single parent with a 10months and two year old trying to manage from check-in to the plane is a true nightmare and staff does not offer any help but feel righteous as they simply follow rules. Dreadful and shameful!
The terminals are always busy but for some reason there is always a calm atmosphere. From an architectural point of view CPH gets top marks as well. The combination of Danish design and the hardwood floors is something I have never seen anywhere else in the world. Shopping facilities are great and the food selection good too (a little expensive). You get some excellent views of the airfield - very nice experience indeed.
Used this airport again and nothing has improved. Everything is still all about forcing you into the expensive shops to make them get your money. All areas without shops are more or less uninviting and seem to be deliberately neglected. The staff every time I go through security at CPH I'm so happy to be fluent in Danish since those who aren't are in for some rude high-handed treatment. Arrivals is also an unpleasant story: On a busy Monday evening they used only 2 of the 9 baggage belts
Arrivals and baggage claim in Terminal 3 was very crowded with some impatient people around. The airport has a quick train link (15 minutes to downtown) with the city centre. Its best to buy your ticket to downtown from the staff-manned booths as the machines aren't very straight forward. Airport is also useful for people traveling to nearby Malmo in Sweden which also has a train link to Copenhagen airport. In departures once you get security side there is a very good selection of restaurants cafes and duty free shops.
While terminal 2 of Copenhagen airport does show its age this is still a charming place to go through. Speedy checking with only a few minutes in the queue. Practically no waiting time at security with friendly and helpful staff both places. Shops are a bit on the pricey side but they do have a wide selection and if you know the normal high street prices you can be lucky and get a bargain. Restaurants are excellent and can be recommended. It can be a bit of a walk from the lounges to the gates and occasionally the queue at passport control can be long but often you wait no more than 5 minutes to get through. Copenhagen Airport is an charming old airport that has managed to follow the times and is still a pleasant experience to go through.
"My worst travel experience ever. At security I was taking my laptop out of my bag (you only get to unpack right at the scanner) when an aggressive attendant grabbed all my belongings out of my hands and shoved the tray through the scanner. Stunned I walked through the scanner but another guard sent be back out rudely saying I cut in front of a family (I didn't). She made me stand just outside the scanner for quite a while like a naughty school kid publicly humiliated while other passengers walked past and looked at me. When she finally said I could go through she continued to berate me saying ""obviously you don't travel much!"". They then kept my bag behind the counter for a further ten minutes until I finally called their supervisor. Their tone changed immediately. They explained I had left my Ipad in my bag and I said ""Yes because you grabbed my things off me before I could finish!"". If you like public humiliation and an alarming sense of powerlessness go to Copenhagen! For me never again."
Friday afternoon 15/6-2012 just prior to peak holiday seasons: The airport was then very crowded and then it becomes cramped to move around with family and luggage it becomes hard and tedious to move fast anywhere though never directly stuck. With only 2 hours time available prior to departure we could not manage to get time for lounge visit as time was lost in packed areas though no queues took more than 15 minutes to overcome. The airport is fantastic as one almost always get direct gate access to flights and do not have to walk far anywhere – i.e. bus transport to a/c are not frequent. Secondly after check-in one gets easily to the 1st floor and from there no more ups and downs as all the rest happens in the same level.
"Arrived in Copenhagen on June 7 (last week) and had no problems. The departure yesterday was a different story and results in my agreeing with other reviewers that this is the worst airport I have been to. The SAS staff will not provide boarding tickets to passengers - - they insist that all passengers use the self-help kiosks whether you are up to the challenge or not. Some of the kiosks were ""frozen"" or the scanner for passports was broken and covered with tape. My email from Orbitz did not provide the correct info for me to get a boarding pass. SAS staff directed me and a lot of other folks to a line for help from one of their colleagues to look up our info in their computer at which point they wrote a number on a slip of paper and sent us back to the kiosks. After that there were the lines for baggage check-in which have already been mentioned by other reviewers as uncontrolled and very chaotic. I found the staff to be ill-tempered. The security was the next process and while I did not find any problems with my granddaughter and I passing through we watched the man ahead of us being treated very disrespectfully by the security agent. Thinking we were finally through all the hurdles there was yet another queue on the way to the gate and many passengers were asking to jump ahead for fear of missing their flights. This line was for another look at our passports. Very stressful and tiring experience with little time left for shopping."
Departed from Copenhagen on afternoon of June 9th from T3. Have to say that we were absolutely disgusted by the total chaos in approaching the security gates. No one minds waiting to get through security as it is obviously essential to safe travel but in T3 it was like a massive rugby scrum and surely the antithesis of security! It started off well enough with a pleasant security officer guiding people into a queue but the queue then approached two information girls who directed people to left or right. On each side there were 6 or so belts but no system of queuing so that everyone was just piling towards the conveyor and security gate in a random fashion pushing and shoving trying to get to the gate. It was actually very unsafe and we were left like this for about 20 minutes whilst trying to get to the security gate. Also counter productive for the airport as when we did eventually get through we were in no mood to look at the shops and just went straight to the departure gate and waited there. In addition it seemed as if the airport staff were totally disinterested in what was happening. Definitely my worse airport experience.
Flew out of Copenhagen for flight home to Australia on Singapore Airlines. Was the worst out of the airports in Europe we had used (others being Amsterdam Frankfurt and Stockholm). Check-in was fine but was abused by airport staff at baggage check for not removing my wallet from my pants. Have not previously had to remove wallet at other airports. Only a two minute wait at baggage check but then about a 15 minute wait at immigration. Only had two booths open for non Danish citizens and a lot of people in the line were getting agitated that they might miss their plane and lots of queue jumping going on with people getting angry. Best tip for airport is to go through passport / immigration control early but once on other side only one shop. Overall not a very inviting airport.
Airport a pleasure: easy to access. Easy to move around and find check-in counters. Not many queues anywhere on an Easter Sunday. Security: again no queue. Plenty of lounges (4-5) with ample space staff service minded and proactive. Precise information from monitors. Passport/immigration: again no waiting time. Gate: No waiting time to enter gate. Waiting time from gate to a/c: 5 minutes. Only announcements in gate areas – otherwise the airport is quiet and relaxing. Toilet facilities plenty and clean. No showers in any lounges (apart from the SAS-lounge). Shopping a bit intrusive as there is no way one can escape confrontation. On the other hand shopping staff were polite decent and knowledgeable.
"From a facility point of view it's a very good airport but staff could benefit from some basic training in how to provide service and be polite (or at least not to be rude and arrogant). Being an international airport it should be no surprise for staff including security staff that some customers do not understand Danish and that harshly repeating the same words in Danish may not get the message through. It may also be useful for all staff especially security staff to be aware of words and phrases like ""please"" ""thank you"" ""can I help you"" etc."
A great airport for passengers light and open spaces but also pretty crowded. The biggest mistake of this airport is the central security that leads into the biggest tax-free shop which is the most expensive I have ever seen. Easy for transfer.
Arriving (T3) and departing (T2) at CPH and found this airport very pleasant indeed: staff at all stations were friendly and co-operative very easy to navigate to and from the metro plus there are plenty of eating and shopping facilities in both terminals. Functional & friendly for visitors to wonderful Copenhagen.
I think that this airport is getting worse and worse over the years. Passenger seats are completely absent. Probably because as other travellers mentioned they chose to transfer the airport into a shopping mall. Everything is extremely expensive and quality food in non existent. The worst experience ever is arriving at CPH. First of all on your way to the baggage belts you have to pass all the way through the shops. When you arrive at the baggage area you realize that only 2-3 belts are in operation each one serving multiple flights at the same time. Waiting times for picking the luggage are very long minimum 30 minutes. Staff is not that helpful and polite. Overall the service is of low quality.
As others have pointed out this airport has turned into a shopping mall with some airline gates. Everything is annoyingly designed to make you go in the shops from herding you from the security check through a giant tax- free shop almost without signage to the total lack of seating in the terminal itself. Airside areas are filthy shabby unwelcoming and with low ceilings. They have a lot of baggage belts at arrivals but usually just use a few of them with bags from several flights arriving on one belt resulting in chaos. Together with often long waiting times that is maybe also a method to make you go to the arrival shop. Also be prepared to walk to and from the gates. There are only a few moving walkways and they are - yes you guessed it only available in areas without shops.
I checked in at Terminal 2 for my flight back to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam. It was a busy Sunday's afternoon. However I managed to get to the departure gate within 40 minutes after having my boarding card at the check-in counter. In general the airport staff were pretty helpful although they were not particularly friendly. Last but not least a few more seats at the departure area would definitely appreciated.
I arrived from Istanbul. The immigration staff were friendly and efficient. Luggage arrived on the belt within 15 minutes. The airport seems pretty crowded at certain periods. The metro service is the best transportation between the airport and the city centre.
I went through the airport 4 times in the past week and what a disappointing experience. Gate B10 from Greenland always has problems with the walkway and we had to wait 40 mins to get off the plane. The baggage trolleys inside the airport are not cleared after 10pm so you can hardly leave the airport with all the blocked trolleys. The airport was generally dirty and not clean. Staff at security-check were rude and unhelpful and did not even help elderly people push their luggage on to the x-ray machine. Altogether a disappointing experience after having been through 4 times in a week. They really need to improve their performance.
What used to be an excellent airport has over the last couple of years been turned into a shopping mall. Copenhagen airport used to be known for its good taste and cosiness - now it is slowly turning into a nightmare. I will in the future chose Amsterdam or Frankfurt as my gateway to Europe.
Most things are fine in this airport except for one thing deciding to put the arrivals hall check-in hall and train station hall all on the same level and in the same place in Terminal 3. This leads to a rugby scrum on busy days with people walking in different directions all bumping into each other. Even when it's not busy it's a bit of an illogical mess.
A shopping centre with a few airline gates tacked on. On arriving from the USA I was forced to walk the entire length of the duty free area to get to my connecting gate. On my return I had to wait in the corridor outside the gate seating area until my flight was ready to board then my boarding pass taken to enter the seating area and once everyone was in the seating area from the corridor the plane boarded. Very inefficient. On the positive side security and customs were a breeze and every worker I encountered was pleasant.
This has to be the most expensive airport anywhere so make sure you are prepared if you face any length of transit time. Drinks of course are expensive a beer is over 5 Euros for example. Food and drink is nothing to write home about and all restaurants are open plan so there is no quiet areas to relax in. Shopping is usual variety but mostly designer shops selling expensive clothes with the airport premium added on. There is no free internet service or anything customer friendly like that. No this is just a big impersonal expensive airport.
Manchester-Copenhagen return. Kastrup is an impressive airport clean modern easy to navigate and staffed by polite and informative staff. Expensive shops however this is to be expected at a Scandinavian airport quality is decent though.
Copenhagen is a great international airport. The service is often great a little busy as all international airports but the staff is friendly and copes with the problem as good as they can. The look of the airport is fantastic. Its sophisticated it has style and is easy to navigate. The time it takes from check-in to the transit hall doesn't take more than maximum 15 minutes with the new security system and the big windows in the transit lounge makes the mood great for flying. One og the downsides is the extremely expensive shops but one doesn't Have to buy anything walking around looking is good enough. The other and biggest downside is the distance between the terminals. Terminal 1 is very far from terminal 2 and 3. There is an airport bus every 10 minutes but not all travelers know this and can therefore experience a rather long walk.
Didn't have a problem here large clean airport with long walking distances but check in and security very smooth. Facilities very good am surprised at other negative comments.
I travel a lot and my trips always start in Copenhgen Airport. I think that its a excellent airport with superb lounges and shopping possibilities and all in all a great place to wait for your flight it is the all time best airport I've been to.
Arriving in Copenhagen is always a pleasure. It is quiet and relaxed and at the same time efficient and clean. In almost two decades of regular flying I have never experienced long queues except for the extended security performed by some US airlines when checking in and at GRU which probably explains why they have the monopoly there. Airport buses are available near terminal 1 and are easy to find and pay for even if you don't speak the lingo.
Easy small modern airport for transfers as well as for final or entry point. Simplicity and short distances make the airport a pleasant experience. Oppose strongly the shopping malls which one is forced (trapped?) to walk through when moving around.
Transitted through CPH and only complaint is that airline lounges are not airside. Had to enter Denmark to get access to Star Alliance Gold Lounge. SAS ground staff very efficient in providing taxi / hotel vouchers for an overnight stay due to aircraft unavailability.
"I was surprised at the inefficiency at this airport. The counter agent ""forgot"" to tag my bag and because of confusion with the conveyor belt not operating properly I didn't notice. It took 3 days to receive my bag in the US. The airport is attractive but the walk from the bus arrival area to the International terminal is horrible - especially in the rain. There are no moving walkways to the gates - a very long distance for physically challenged and people with small children. The security check is the worst I've ever encountered - carryon bags were dumped out contents removed and refused (a can of fish) and I was patted down without benefit of a choice of a female agent (I am female). A second security check at the gate area resulted in the plane leaving late because the checking agency (US) could not connect and verify many passenger IDs. I will avoid this airport at all costs even if I have to pay more to fly through another location"
Very good airport. We arrived with delay from Milan and had to take another flight in only 30 minutes: everything ok also with the baggage. Boarding without any problem.
I use the airport approx 2 times weekly for a mixture of domestic european and intercontinental flights. I find it efficient pleasant clean and very easy to navigate. It's also a plus that transport to and from Copenhagen city is fast comfortable and reliable.
Used this airport the first time to start a cruise from Copenhagen. Very good place with a big shopping arcade. We were disappointed when we left Copenhagen we could not see a fast line for business tickets.
Flew into Copenhagen Kastrup from Vienna by Tyrolean. The signs were clear a long walk past all the duty free shops to get to the baggage claim. The counter for buying tickets for onward journey to Malmo could be a bit confusing for first timer. Flying out from Kastrup is another story - not very friendly.
Arriving at pier A resulted in quite a lengthy walk to the exit area. Had carry-on luggage only but noticed very long waiting times for baggage reclaim. Railway station located just after exit. Ticket kiosks easy to use but check that you use the correct machine - DSB kiosks sell tickets for all Danish destinations grey SJ machines are mostly for long-distance cities in Sweden red or violet Skanetrafiken machines sell tickets for Southern Sweden. Transfer to the Swedish city of Malmo is convenient - modern regional trains shuttle over the Oresund bridge every 20 mins. Travel time is around 25 mins and costs 105SEK one-way. Departing CPH is a mixed experience. Self-service machines did not work properly so had to lose half an hour as only two check-in desks were open. Flying back on Saturday evening meant no waiting at security. However staff there very unfriendly not to say downright rude - no words spoken only some vague gestures. Airside the terminal resembles a large shopping mall. Catering facilities overpriced but of good quality - spent around 150DKK for an orange juice and three fresh open-faced sandwiches. Toilets moderately clean and always located in some hidden corners.
Getting increasingly disappointed with arriving at CPH airport. With my 12 arrivals in the past 6 weeks there were only 2 occasions where I waiting for my luggage for less than 30 minutes the screen information giving incorrect information. on 2 occasions information on the luggage arrivals belt even 'disappeared' from the screens. Whenever I enquired with the not always very airport staff unexpected snowfall was the univocal explanation. It's winter and this is Scandinavia! I can only attribute these 'unexpected snowfall' explanations to excuses for providing inferior and lazy service standards.
I have used Copenhagen Airport hundreds of times and this airport has never disappointed. The design of Terminal 3 bright light spacious modern and yet cosy. The walk to/from gates can be a little long though. Staff is friendly and attentive and the transfer possibilities and facilities are excellent.
Used Copenhagen for flight from Moscow to London via this airport. A very quiet airport. Food is quite a rip off though and not a lot of facilities.
All flights T3. Arrived from Narita and straight into a full security check which seemed bizarre. Transferring on SAS to Manchester. No seating outside departure lounge so bodies sitting/lying in the corridors. Flight display outside gate not working so fingers crossed no change to gate prior to flight. Quite a bit of renovations going on nice wooden floors going in hopefully some seating too. 3 weeks later arrived from Heathrow landed at 1700 caught the 1736 train to Malmo after clearing immigration and baggage control.
It was horrible to travel out of Copenhagen Saturday 20. of June 2009 due to low manning and/or low capacity to handle the amount of passengers. Arriving at the airport more than 1 hour and 20 minutes prior to the scheduled flight-time of the plane to London should be sufficient enough. First the automatic check-in facilities did not recognize my reservation number even though there had been no changes in the reservation since the purchase 10 days prior. I and a handfull of other passengers were sent to a line for passengers with problems using the check-in machines. This line was handled by one person only and 25 minutes prior to departure after being in line for 40 minutes we finally convinced an employee to check us in separately and bypass the line. We were met by another big line at the security control but just managed to get on the airplane by running through the entire terminal. The staff appeared to be in a bad mood no wonder and one member even critizised us for arriving at the airport too late. When I arrived in North America 18 hours later the local baggage service informed me that my suitcase had not left Copenhagen Airport yet. Rail transportation to the airport works excellent though. I would like to have reviewed other aspects of the airport but I did not have the time to notice that.
Pleasant experience in Copenhagen airport. Transport links to the centre of the city are excellent. On arrival we took the Metro from the airport to Norreport metro station - took about 10 mins. Check in on the way home (Sun mid afternoon) was very quick - done via one of the automatic machines which even print your luggage tag - no queue at bag drop. Only problem was at security - very long queues and despite videos showing you what you need to do (take off belts etc) people were still waiting until they got to the security check before taking off jackets/ putting liquids in bags etc. Once through security nice airy terminal and plenty of shops.
Some things work really well in CPH others don't. The walking distance from domestic to international is killing. The staff is usually OK but not as friendly and relaxed as in Billund. The lounges I've tried are not worth bragging about - Novia is small crammed has obnoxious staff and little food/drink selection. Servisair is better more roomy and offers separate smoking room and massage chairs. The atmosphere is a bit gloomy though. I expect the SAS lounge to be much better but I haven't been there for years as they don't accept Priority Pass. On the good side the shopping options are very good and unlike most other airports you actually don't get ripped off. If the sign says Sale then you actually are saving substantially compared to normal prices. Restaurants are high class and there's plenty to choose from. And the general design of the airport is modern lightyears better than Arlanda in Stockholm similar to Gardermoen in Oslo but not quite as nice as Billund.
Only ever transferred here and it is good in that respect. It is quite big but roomy and with quite a lot of options to wile away one or two hours. I do not know what it is like outside but it is a good transfer location.
Copenhagen Airport has turned into a shopping centre and has become very poor. So if you want a smooth check-in security control pass immigrations luggage handling by arrival fair prices for parking etc. then avoid Copenhagen Airport! If you live in Denmark or Sweden then don't pay the horrible fees for parking. Public transport to Copenhagen or Malmo/Sweden by rail is fast cheap and comfortable. Check-in be prepared for long lines and crowding - especially if you are travelling economy. Security control long lines and crowding. The security control is absolutely not efficient compared with other airports. E.g. why haven't they established a conveyor belt or tables along the lines so you are able to prepare your jacket belt mobile laptop etc. for scanning while waiting? After the security control don't expect to find information and which gate the flight leaves from. Instead be prepared to disappear in a crowded shopping centre. This is very stressing and you have a very high risk for missing your flight because you can't estimate walking time. And be aware - the prices in the airport is not competitive with shops in Copenhagen. There is not very much public space in the airport (because of all the shops) so be prepared for a long and crowded walking distance to the gate. When arriving to Copenhagen Airport be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for the luggage handling. Also be prepared for long lines in immigrations.
CPH has at long last regulated smoking thus removing what was always its biggest drawback: the need to walk through great clouds of tobacco smoke just to get to the gate. It's elegant and clean with extensive shopping facilities and the distances between gates are no worse than at comparable airports. The airport police was very helpful and friendly when my wife misplaced her purse. Note however that I almost always use CPH as a transfer point rather than an origin/destination airport so I can't really comment on the landside end of things.
I used CPH four times this month and it's hard to find a better airport in Europe. Rapid check-in kind staff and a great deal of shopping facilities! Security procedures are smooth and almost no wait for your luggage. Metro and DSB trains connect CPH with central Copenhagen in less than 15 minutes (there are trains every few minutes). The only complaint could be about the long distances between gates.
Mixed feelings. Bright and very nice design. Long walks (too long I would say). Fells overcrowded. Very convenient check-in machines where you can get boarding pass for virtually any airline. Great transport links to the city and to Malmo. Confusing layout of airside zone. After Heathrow 5 or Hong Kong it lacks clear straight direction from A to B. Going from check in to gate and using signs I made 2 circles and 1 U-turn. Not easy. All in all good facility very clean with helpful staff. 4 star.
The Airport is clean transport from the city smooth by train but ways are very long and it seems like the airport was probably built with a lot of over-capacity. Still it lacks of check-in- facilities and queuing is even required for business. And what is that policy about having to check in hard-shell suitcases as odd sized luggage? (Which led to the not-arrival of my suitcase at Destination) I have never experienced that in any other airport around the world.
This airport has everything its Scandinavian counterparts lack. Extremely nice design unlike Stockholm and extremely good shopping centre and food unlike Oslo. I had the best seafood in years cannot imagine a better airport to spend a few hours. Transfer folks friendly (SAS) new and peaceful waiting areas at the B gates good selection and prices in duty-free. Can't wait to come back one day after they finish the works.
Despite arriving at a semi-empty airport we had to be bussed to the terminal rather than use the finger which we had pulled right up to. Always annoying. Public transport to Copenhagen by rail is fast cheap and comfortable. First class! Departing Copenhagen one noticed that there was a lot of building work going on. There were too many shops crowding in on public areas as well which makes it look more and more like a UK airport which is not a good sign. Finally many passengers nearly missed their flights to various UK destinations since there was one immigration officer at the piers passport control. I have never seen such long lines in an EU airport. It felt as though I was trying to leave the old Soviet Union.
The airport was very unimpressive - very long walks to get from where you are to where you want to be and confusing to get around. The worst part is that I am a non smoker and it is VERY difficult to find smoke-less air when walking around or waiting for your luggage (there was a table with an umbrella under which smokers needed to stand and smoke - but nothing to draw the smoke away from coming right into the luggage area room). We had a long walk from arrival to get to the main area - and these little smoker areas were in the narrow hallways all the way through-out - could not escape the smoke. The shopping area is very nice - but when getting out of the area the smoke hits you again. The restaurant area is quite smoky - hard to find a place to sit where one can breathe without smoke.
The terminal was busy but staff were friendly. I was impressed with the security screening how fast and efficient it was. There is a good selection of shops bars and cafes and places to sit.
I would like to add to the previous comment about signage at CPH. As soon as you have been screened at security the departure gate screens are ahead of you. I will agree that more screens are needed. In terms of gate status - that is usually down to the gate agent. Especially low cost carriers like EasyJet don´t have their gates announced until 30 40 mins before departure. Which is understandable as they have typically very short 25 min turnarounds. I like the new direct metro link which is a huge time saver and has made this Airport extremely accessible. The self service check in at the metro platform is a nice touch. The only thing that let´s it down is the lack of escalators from Metro station down to Check in and arrival level. There are elevators but even so this was a design error in my opinion. With all the new enhancements I would have hoped that they would have installed moving walkways between pier A and security/baggage claim. It´s a very long treck now. Otherwise this airport is still a firm favourite of mine.
The signage has become very poor after the airport was turned into a shopping centre with a possibility to fly - if you can find a FIDS screen telling which gate you have to go to! I normally want to perform check-in pass immigrations and security control find which gate the flight leaves from (in order to estimate walking time) before I relax do some shopping have a cup of coffee etc. But in Copenhagen you are led into a shopping centre first - and not until you have passed that can you find information - that is: If it does show the gate at all. I had to wait until 40 minutes before departure before the gate was shown - and then with the note: Go to gate!
I live in Sweden but I prefer to fly from CPH. Fabulous seafood in the one of the most famous seafood restaurant. Upper class airport great and fast service almost no queues. Check in to USA flights - maximum 10 min. European flights - you can use a lot of check in kiosks - really good and fast. Shopping a paradise for frequent airport shoppers.
I love this airport. We have been stuck on big delays here on a few different trips and dare I say it was an absolute pleasure. There is actually some amazing dining here I had one of my favorite meals of our trip in their lovely airy seafood restaurant. Great shopping wonderful open design. Really great. One of my favorites in the world.
This is clearly my favourite airport in Europe! Cozy and beautiful at the same time. It's got everything you need and is the only airport I would voluntarily get stuck in waiting!
Clean and modern just poorly designed. Depending on the gate you arrive at or depart from you may be in for a long walk. A good range of shops and restaurants in airside but very little around the check-ins. Excellent public transport connections to Kopenhagen and Malmo (Sweden)
"The ladies toilets were in a dreadful state. Only one had toilet paper and only 3 were in use. The door locks were also broken. There were rags on the floor and the bins with used toilet paper had no lids. There was only one facility offering hot food and drink. The coffee which was weak and insipid, came from a large urn. It tasted as if it had been made with sour milk and totally undrinkable. There were no tables to sit and eat at. Items for sale were overpriced and unappetising - mainly tired looking savoury pasties. There was no fresh fruit or salad or bread. The shops and duty free were fine and there was a good selection of reasonably priced Greek traditional food and alcoholic drinks. Also there was plenty of seating albeit metal chairs."
"Without doubt the worst airport I have used.  Firstly upon arrival the check in desks were not opened on time followed by a poor system of having to then queue again to place your luggage through an X-ray machine. Stupid idea that causes more havoc when initially checking in. Once through to the departure lounge things do not get any better. You are immediately hit by the heat through poor to no air conditioning, making waiting for your flight very uncomfortable. A poor selection of newspapers and refreshments make the whole experience very disappointing. Toilets are diabolical and had so many out of order. On a plus point the wifi was good as I pen this review."
I cannot believe that this is an airport in Europe. Very unfriendly check in staff. Officials show no interest in security. Food and beverage  offering is non existant and dirty. Looks like this airport was never renovated nor cleaned since its opening.
"On arrival I was very pleased with how quickly we got through passport control and got our cases. Our departure was a different case altogether. We arrived in plenty of time (3 hours before take-off) and we then joined a queue to check in our luggage. We were 6th in the queue and it took us 45 minutes to get checked in, then we moved to another queue to put our cases through and then another queue to go through security. In total it took us 1 hour 35 mins to get through to the departure lounge. Then we had to check in at the gate. Not sure why as we then had to sit down for another hour. I thought (maybe) that we would then get through the departure gate quicker but no we had to queue again and check in again before going through. Not sure of the purpose of the double check-in? The toilets were disgusting. I asked if there were any cleaner toilets but sadly these were the only ones in the departure area. Out of 8 cubicles 3 were broken. So dissapointed after a great holiday in Corfu that the airport has really let it down."
"Travelled into Corfu in 2014 to find in hadn't moved on since I last flew in in 1976. Not fit for purpose. Travelled in again this year (15 June) and out again 22nd June. At least this year got our bags very quickly when arriving so scarpered nice and quickly. And when departing check in (Jet2.com desks) was relatively quick and painless. Unfortunately for others they had, once again, to queue outside for ages in strong hot sunshine before even getting to the check in desks. Crawled through security and then into the simply awful departure 'lounge'. This airport is sadly still not fit for purpose, and with things being what they are economically won't change any time soon."
worst airport I've been to they have far too many passengers for the capacity of the airport the security queue is at the same location as the check-in counters and as there is only two security scanners at the airport the security queue gets so big that it is almost impossible just to get to the queue for the check-in counters. The check in counters have a weird system where you have to take your bag to another location at the airport to get it checked when you have checked in at the counter it would surprise me if everybody in the security queue were able to catch their flight in time as it was so slow that it almost took all the 2 hours that you got from check-in counters opening to the flight leaving just to get through the security queue.
EMA-Corfu-EMA 2 June out and 9 June return. I hadn't used Corfu Airport since my last visit some 35 years ago but things do not appear to have improved! Typical Greek Airport - lots of flights on the same day (and probably all crammed into the same hour). There are now two luggage belts but the TV screens telling you which belt is for your flight are almost unreadable as you have to look directly into the sun to see them. Chaos reigns when you come to depart - queuing outside in the sun for an hour or so absolutely rammed through security into the departure lounge as all the flights now depart at or about the same time! This was an early June Monday morning - nowhere near the peak season - and the airport isn't really fit for purpose. Facilities once through security are minimal and there are just not enough seating areas. I suppose one of the charms of the Greek Islands is the laid back thing - but with their airports much patience is required just think of a cold beer and a nice Greek salad.
Into and out of Corfu on late night flights before the main season started so we had no problems with crowds or queuing. Travelling with hand luggage only made things even easier. Passport control in either direction was very casual to say the least but security on departure seemed reasonably thorough without causing any serious holdups. We only bought a bottle of water airside as we know buying anything at Corfu airport can be expensive. Only one agent to handle boarding for our flight but she got us through the gate swiftly and efficiently. All in all this passage through CFU was almost a breeze compared with our last two trips when we experienced long delays before departure.
Flew out of here to Gatwick. Overall airport is not great and having had to drop our car off early and then a four hour wait meant we ended up using the airport cafe and snack bar. All I can say is what an absolute rip-off - 7 Euros for a coke and a peppermint tea 3.60 Euros for an ice cream lollipop. The food was equally expensive and tasteless. It might be slightly less galling if the surroundings were pleasant but they aren't - no air conditioning and dirty tables. Corfu is a lovely place but the airport really lets it down.
Average holiday airport really facilities are nothing amazing just one shop for sandwiches pastries etc and the usual Duty Free but for a small Mediterranean airport you can't really expect a state-of-the-art shopping complex so I've got nothing to complain about there really. However my biggest complaint is yes you guessed it the queues outside. I understand that when I flew out it was the busiest day for UK flights with constant movement on the tarmac but it was hardly the first busy holiday airport I'd ever been to and I'd never experienced that before. The check-in area was hardly rammed when we finally got in so I don't understand that one. And after we'd been to the check-in desk and had our bags weighed we had to then lug our baggage to the end of the row of check in desks to actually put our bags through. Again that was new to me. Apart from that queues weren't too bad and I didn't feel like the terminal was overcrowded although it was very busy with loads of people going home to Manchester Gatwick Newcastle Leeds Glasgow Cardiff etc etc.
Don't book with Thomson as you have to queue for hours outside the airport if you fly with them whilst other companies passengers just sail through. Its chaos. Thomson reps are rude and speak to their customers badly. You are nothing better than cattle to them! Once actually allowed inside the building you queue to check in then and then there is a huge queue for security and people with suitcases who take them on board as hand luggage just hold up the system as they have don't appear to be able to read! It is a requirement that you have to get out electrical appliances from hand luggage etc to go through security but it doesn't seem to matter how long these customers queue for they simply don't think the rules apply to them and then hold up the queue whilst they make space for themselves to sort out their items at the last minute! Its chaos.
Avoid if you can. We just returned from there 2 days ago. Unfriendly rude staff. Chaos everywhere. A huge queue to pass security and passport control. Once you finally pass it you find crowds of people from about 15 different flights all cramped in a small waiting room and there are only 5 departure gates. My boyfriend and myself wanted to sit next to each other in the waiting area as our flight was in 2 hours. We couldn't find 2 seats next to each other. Children were crying. People pushing each other as there is enough space to even walk around. Only one coffee shop to buy something to drink. Forget if you are hungry. One type of a small sandwich (5 euros!) and it wasn't fresh. Over priced shops.
Pretty poor airport but it does the important things ok. Food and drink wise there is a cafe/bar landside and some sort of Taverna outside but all you have airside is a smallish outlet serving sandwiches/pies and drinks (if you're lucky) and unbelievably doesn't accept cards of any type. Worse than that there is no allocated seating beyond a few small stands. Just to round things off the staff were rude and miserable. There is no cash machine airside nor is there a drinking fountain should you get thirsty and have no Euros. On top of that you are packed in with far too many people for the seating available. There are a couple of duty free shops. Thankfully there is air conditioning or it would be pretty unbearable. If you are a smoker then get your fix before you go through security if you have a long wait for your flight as there is no smoking anywhere. Note take no notice of your holiday rep telling you to queue outside. It'll be boiling hot and there is nothing to stop you waiting in the air conditioned terminal or going to the cafe upstairs. A pretty poor show for such a busy (at least in season) airport. Corfu is not some small little island that only sees a flight a day and it should have an airport that is appropriate to modern needs. Having said that Greece is really going through it at the moment so nothing much is going to change anytime soon. It won't bother me though I'm not going back to Corfu again. It's a tatty old place these days and there are far better places to spend your holidays.
Really rude staff made to pay for excess baggage 180 euros even though we had group booking and did not have to pay on the way out. Our Thomas Cook rep said it was okay to weigh all cases together once at airport but staff made me pay for my bag individually. Will not travel to this airport again.
Airport a shambles we had to stand outside in a queue for about an hour with our 8 year old grandson in the midday heat then in a queue to check in then a long queue for passport control - in total about 2 hours. When finally in departures had time just to get some water before boarding. Lovely island but won't be back because of airport need to be at least twice the size for volume of people.
We arrived in Corfu from London Gatwick with Tor Air as soon as we arrived we disembarked onto a nice air conditioned bus which carted us to the terminal. On entry to the terminal the ground staff were friendly asking if we needed assistance. Everything fine in Arrivals picked bags up which was a 10 minute wait from Aircraft to carousel. Went to the rental car kiosks no problems. On the way back check in was swift and pleasant security clearance was a breeze oh and the Aircraft was early and we boarded and left early. All in all couldn't fault Corfu Airport and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
Horrible airport surly staff. We queued for hour and half in the sun just to get inside. When we did I was subjected to an aggressive body search (I am a 56 year old woman) and told to empty my hand luggage. I refused had had enough of their treatment and told them so. I was allowed through.
Just returned from a cruise of the Greek islands with our flight back from Corfu airport. Again we had to queue outside in midday heat to get inside taxi drivers were on strike and all walking about the main stretch. Inside we stood in a queue to have our cases weighed very surly staff with no greeting. I had an excess baggage charge which shocked me I was told I could not have my boarding card and sent to an empty booth for 20 mins until a woman told me I owed 48 Euro for my baggage slapped the change down and walked off. Once through and heading to our gate boarding cards were torn off without a smile or even looking at the passengers while talking to another staff member. It left a bad taste in our mouth we shall avoid this airport from now on.
Just returned from Paleokastritsa - in 1971 the terminal building was merely a small villa type dwelling where you passed through customs and they crossed your case with chalk I understand the building is still there. No hassle or queuing in those days and then off in an awaiting taxi to the destination. May 2011 we find hoards of people congregating outside the terminal. Once inside the arrivals/departure hall was far too small. Large numbers of people with children had to wait outside the main departure hall in temperatures of 30+C. Once inside the departure hall it was chaos. People checking in were mixing with people waiting to enter Passport Control and you just could not find the end of the line you needed to get into. Airline reps were ushering people in all different directions and at one stage we came to a halt because people outside were given priority to go through Passport Control as a last call for their flight to Manchester was announced over the intercom system it was an utter shambles. Anyway after an hour and a half we finally managed to get into the departure lounge exhausted but thankful we allowed sufficient time to check in. For a holiday destination where some areas of the island were not officially open until June we were amazed at the number of people departing on one day.
The arrivals/departure hall was obviously far too small for the volume of traffic. Large numbers of people had to wait in line outside the main departure hall in temperatures of 38C. Once inside found the departure hall to be total chaos. The staff points were rude and unhelpful even snatching the passports and tickets from our hands in an aggressive manner. The prices for food etc were a joke with the staff adopting a couldn't care less attitude. I will never book a holiday via this airport again - without doubt the worst we have used.
There are good and bad points for CFU. The major change is the attitude of the staff - obviously the Greek economic crisis has made the staff worried about their jobs but they are not winning friends with a 'why are you coming to our airport' attitude . Still have to queue outside but the Thomson Airways staff did their best to minimise the hassle.
"Plenty of time to study Corfu Airport as we had a 6 hour delay for the return flight courtesy of easyJet. In some respects it has improved in the intervening period eg. more space in the departure lounge but in others it remains the same eg. rip-off prices for refreshments. Arrival was easy particularly since we were on hand luggage only and there were few other flights at that time. Departure seemed smooth enough too until the delay became apparent. We acted on the advice of previous correspondents and entered through Arrivals but in any case the check-in area was not too crowded. Seeing that the departure lounge had plenty of empty seats we went swiftly to security (short queues) and were through quite quickly. Our online paper boarding ""cards"" did seem to be a cause of some surprise though. We were quite impressed by the security staff who were both pleasant and efficient. I forgot to extract my liquids bag from my hand luggage: it was spotted on the scanner I was asked politely to open my bag and after the contents were inspected I was thanked. On our second passage through having had to go back to the landside restaurant for our free ""light refreshments"" the pencils my wife invariably carries in the top of her socks were spotted and investigated: no one else has ever noticed them on any of our trips abroad. The departure lounge did become crowded at times announcements were hard to hear - partly because of the combined noise of several hundred people but also because of the speed at which many of them were made - and the screens were less than informative or up-to-date. There seemed to be long queues at the food counter and if the prices we saw as we had our free refreshments in the restaurant were any indication the airport must be making a mint (each free pie + bottle of water would have cost 5 euros with a 1.50 euro cover charge on top). Predictably enough our spare unopened bottle of water handed out in the restaurant upstairs then had to be surrendered at security downstairs but the security lady was charming about it. When we returned to the departure lounge after our refreshments it was much quieter and there was room to spread out for the rest of our wait though the metal seats are scarcely comfortable. Also why are they in threes when so many passengers are in couples? Overall a mixture of pluses and minuses but I would give it 3 stars rather than 2 because of the surprisingly positive impression we gained of the security staff."
For a busy holiday airport this has the worst departure lounge facilities we have experienced! If you are in need of refreshment as we were there is no cafe just a long queue to a buffet counter where you are ripped off! We had to pay over 15 Euro for two small lukewarm barely drinkable coffees a miniscule tooth breaking baguette and a soft drink. This was virtually thrown at us by two disinterested girls who probably would not understand the meaning of common courtesy or customer satisfaction. Only a couple of the monitors mounted from the ceiling were working - others broken or switched off and nothing like enough of the hard metal seats to accommodate the crowd of people who were waiting for flights when we were there. Toilet facilities are very poor which I would not like to elaborate on! I pity anyone who has to spend any length of time in this confined area.
I agree with the comments by Phil McVey (12 August 2008)
Airport very busy but found arriving by hire car just as check in opened meant there were no queues. Check in took 5 mins stayed in upstairs cafe until 40 mins before departure time and walked straight through departures onto bus for aircraft. Plenty of staff around all went well and seemed well organised. Main issue is as others have said tour reps blocking the areas. All in all though a much better experience than expected.
Agree with Sue Nicholas's comments re independent travellers and problems with tour reps. Here's what I have done last 5 years returning from golf holiday. Presume you are arriving by car or taxi. Time it so you arrive just about start of your check in. Don't drop off or go direct to departures from the road but go inside via the arrivals section and walk through to departure thus bypassing all the reps and crowds outside. Normally at most airports arrival and departure are separated but not at Corfu.
My wife and I have experienced Corfu airport on more than one occasion and although it seems small for the amount of passengers it handles I can honestly say that no real problems have as yet been encountered. We were once delayed upon departure for four hours (nothing to do with security checks and queues elsewhere) while a problem with our outbound flight was resolved. The aircraft was a B767-300 for anyone interested. Because of this they allowed us outside where a huge amount of chairs had been arranged under canvas to keep the hot sun off (30 degrees). This reduced congestion inside the building. We went back in with an hour to go and eventually departed Corfu. Great flight good crew and no complaints worthy of note. Problems happen with aircraft and I'm always happy to wait for the right people to fix them!
Having been a frequent visitor to the island over the past ten years I can confirm that the airport has gone from unorganised chaos to organised chaos! It is fair to say that the staff and management at the airport have done a lot to get their act together but still seem to do things the greek way and to greek time. The new system of checking into receive boarding passes and then taking your cases to the end of the check in desk for scanning does seem to be speeding up the queues but i still have to ask why they have to make this a separate procedure? On my visit in July the new check in system worked so well that the queue for passport control was now snaking twice round all the way back out of the terminal and back in and up to the one security guard checking passports. Two Guards would have made this easier and faster but then how would the hand baggage scanners keep up? The Airport have to build in delays somewhere along the chain and make passengers queue somewhere along the line otherwise they just would not cope with the demand and the whole process would just collapse! The Airport does not help matters when it herds all non domestic passengers through one end of the terminal leaving the other end of the terminal that is used for internal flights empty. They could also scan luggage once it has been checked in. As for the tour operators? I know most seem to work to a Monday/Friday system but i think some also go on Tuesdays. We have to share the airport with other tour operators from other countries like Germany and the airport has allocated other days of the week to them otherwise it would never cope. I think the thing that frustrates us all is why three or four planes from the UK arrive within the hour and snarl up the arrivals system? The baggage reclaim hall is tiny with only two carousels. Everyone is also too impatient when arriving into the hall to reclaim their baggage! When you arrive in the hall just relax and take your time! Use the toilet find a trolley or make contact with your holiday rep in arrivals or collect your hire car. Corfu is not like our airports and you can wander freely into the arrivals hall at any time to sort out what you need to. It always amuses to see a plane load of passengers jostling for position at the carousel and then waiting half an hour for the belt to spring into life. The Greeks do not rush and they certainly don't worry about a hall full of impatient passengers!
The previous comments are all spot on - but on rare days it can work like a dream. Returned from Aghios Gordios Friday Aug 10th at 11 pm for a 01:00am flight to East Midlands. Disembarked the minibus at 23:45 check in desk open luggage straight into scanners and through passport control by midnight and on the plane around 00:30 ready for take-off. Meanwhile passengers for other destinations were queuing as described though I spotted that new sheltered seating had been provided outside since I was last there. I dread to think what it could have been like had the visitor numbers not been so visibly down since my last visit. The local taverna owners all commented on it. I've come to expect to be patient waiting for luggage on the way into Corfu but much worse are the queues for departures when you're tired and a bit fed up at the thought of going home at all! The worst part of the trip was the flight home on the most uncomfortable plane I've ever been in. Corfu Airport is a lovely little airport and I have to agree it surely would work so much better if the holiday companies managed their collection of travellers from resorts with more regard for the airport's handling facilities and staggered their arrivals and departures better through the week.
As an independent traveller I am amazed that company reps seem to have so much control or imply they have control over who waits in and outside the terminal building for flights. The tour companies must take responsibility for their own customers and not interfere with independent travellers. Half of the congestion is caused by the tour operators collecting customers for a number of flights on the same coach meaning many are arriving at the airport well in advance of their required check in time! I travel to Corfu at least twice a year and have done so for the past 10 yrs. The tour operators are causing most of the problems by bringing flights in on basically two transfer days. It has got worse not better over time. What they need to remember is that passengers are their clients and it is they who should be calling the tune not the other way round and certainly passengers should not be herded around like sheep when they pay such prices for their holidays!! The airport and its staff are wonderful. It is clean and tidy everyone is friendly. Scanners were better this May than they have been in the past. Tour companies are the problem!
Tom Phillips has got it just about right! We have just returned from Corfu from our 6th holiday there in seven years. Olympic Airways are simply choking the airport to death they will not allow enough flights to satisfy the demand from holiday makers and villa/studio owners. We hear the same old story all over the island too few flights and mostly on Fridays and Mondays from the UK. If it were not for the reps from the tour operators happily helping customers out inside the terminal half the flights would never get off the ground. The reps are great they help all travellers irrespective of who they are booked with. They seem to know that if they don't do there best to make it all work their jobs will inevitably be on the line before long. Shame that Olympic seem to be completely oblivious to this. Visitor numbers are visibly down this year and this is confirmed by restaurant owners car hire companies and those offering accomodation. I guess that that many who experienced the new systems at the airport last summer may not all have returned this year.
After a number of years when the authorities did not care about its passengers the Corfu authorities seem to have got the formula right at last! It is still too small for the amount of people using the airport but it now does seem to run like a well oiled machine. The flights tend to be on time and the turn round of the aircraft seems efficient. Land and away in a little over an hour. However the departure lounge tends to be as overcrowed as it was when I first went to Corfu in 1985.
Passed through last week with family (eight pax including two small children). Sadly not only does Corfu never get better it’s now got even worse. The main problem is that nearly all charter flights arrive and depart at the same time on the same day so unless you’re arriving on a scheduled flight from Athens at some other time the place is always swamped. The arrivals hall is as cramped and smoky as ever with far too few luggage carousels
I travelled through here for the Cork Jazz Festival weekend and was quite impressed. The airport is calm and quiet and I thought facilities airside were very good - the bar has good food and is like a good pub.
I agree with the earlier comments a lovely easy-to-use airport. Flew in and out on Aer Lingus Heathrow service - inbound parked against and airbridge outbound no airbridge but it was a lovely day!
Lovely new spacious Terminal building but needs some atmosphere. Also need to return Rome to their departures listing. Airbridges would be useful as most of the times I've been through there it's raining and passengers get wet walking the tarmac to the terminal building then no lift to the next level only stairs.
Airport is great for tourist travel but poor for business. No fast track through security. Business lounge is small and poorly kept (dirty drinking glasses poor availability of food dirty tables). That's a pity as otherwise airport is great.
Cork airport is a new modern building. I had no lost baggage. I flew with Aer Lingus. Airport has nice catering with cafes and shops. The loop is very nice. Easy accessible parking.
Nice airy new building spoilt by lack of airside facilities. No airbridge no hot food no water fountain. Free wi-fi though.
Clean spacious check in is quick and bag pick up on return is relatively quick - exactly what you want in a terminal to be fair. I have used this airport a number of times and its design makes the place look cavernous - some music on speakers please as there is no atmosphere whatsoever and it is always seems eerie quiet. Also no airbridges in 2012. Cork get it together! What is the point in having a palace of an airport only to walk across the tarmac in the pouring rain getting drenched the howling wind and cold! Also on arrival - one faces flights of stairs to get into the terminal - especially when you see a 2 airbridges idle and which appear out of use.
MAN-ORK quick procedure in entrance small and easy to find everything good service counters.
I was impressed with the Terminal and facilities. A longish wait in Departures was no problem as its spacious and airy. Free Wi-Fi and decent book shop bonus points too.
I haven't been to Cork since the new terminal building opened. On a Sunday morning the airport was quiet but we skipped through immigration and bags were back to us very quickly. The new layout is functional but it appears to work well.
Despite airbridges had to walk across a cold rain drenched apron likewise on departure. Then up two flights of stairs to get to passport control. A woman just bypassed the queue at this stage and walked out through an unmanned desk. Remarkable. Luggage took a while to arrive on the carousel our aircraft was the only one on the apron. Departure was more buisness like.
Modern terminal
Landside the new terminal is very good check in desks very organised and good for snacks and meals bank wcs etc. Although airside is poor regarding food and drink outlets. Nice panoramic view of runway from departure gates and lounge area.
The new terminal at Cork is much larger than the old one but is still easy to get around. The baggage halls are poor. There are also very few seating areas in baggage hall. The check-in halls and the departures areas are much better and have good views of the ramp area which is nice. There is also a much improved selection of eating areas before security although it is limited once airside.
New terminal just opened and looks very european - spacious good layout and good sign posting. New terminal only being used for arrivals at the minute and so departures was through the old terminal which was unfortunate. On departure the duty free shop sells books and magazines but no newspapers a sign says that newspapers are available for sale before you go through security but to get to the duty free shop in the first place you have to pass through security with no one allowed back out - I hope someone works that one out before the new terminal opens for departures.
An easy airport to get through. Current terminal is very small. Departure lounge has six gates but there are not enough seats for all the passengers of six flights. There were only three flights waiting to leave when I was there two weeks ago and already all the seats were taken with a large number of people standing. I hate to think what it would be like in the height of summer when all six gates are taken. However this should all be remedied when the new larger terminal building is opened. All the staff were friendly and helpful and adequate parking.
Arrived there for a daytrip from LHR. It was quite a walk across the tarmac but this should be sorted when the new terminal is opened. On departure the eating facilities on landside were adequate for a small airport. On airside there was pretty much nothing to do. It was restricted to a very limited bar and the usual duty free shop
With the new automated Boarding Pass terminals the check-in is pretty speedy which makes the check-in efficient. Restaurant & bar upstairs are reasonable and deliver good quality food & drink (helpful staff!). Friendly ground-personnel and no need to run a marathon to reach the gate makes it a relaxing experience. Once you go though the security and passport check you seem to arrive in quite a different country all-together: 'tax-free' is a complete rip-off prices of salmon are triple(!) of that in Cork (same trademark and quantity) so duly you bleed for your families request. A cup of coffee at the bar suffers the same added-value while seemingly being made out a mixture of tarmac and dishwater here the personnel seems to be trained not to understand any language (I tried 3) and so ignoring my protest (he was probably rightfully to ashamed to respond). The permanent wind over the tarmac - Cork airport is on the top of a hill - blows you right in the direction of your plane. Arriving back is a breeze after a good lunch upstairs (I don't like the grub in planes) missing the bus I queried a cab-driver: € 42 for airport to Cobh so I informed him it was € 30 the other way around with a Cobh taxi firm his response: 'Ah ye see that's why we don't allow them for pickup any fares from here' welcome home.
Cork is handy with a Bus Eireann Coach service every 30 mins into Cork city itself. The city is not at all far away so if in a group I'd get a taxi. The airport has a very warm feeling at Christmas time when it welcomes all its lost sons and daughters home. I believe a planned expansion is about to take place? I would like to see more services between Cork & LHR not to mention international flights - perhaps all in time. The downside to this airport has to be its cafes and restaurants- especially airside- its terrible. Instead I find myself wandering aimlessly over the fragrances until my senses have been somewhat numbed. After which I'm ready to board a plane (usually to STN and its horrific onward connections).
It looks like a white elephant but what an elegant one! Corpus Christi appears to handle only connecting flights to Dallas and Houston (that's the international bit) with just three airlines operating there. It is light bright airy and wonderfully free of the normal hustle and bustle of a modern airport. Checking in took three minutes
Very small airport. Check-in starts 1.5-2 hours before departure. The small cafe on the right is the only place with a clean toilet and AC. When you have checked in there is nothing! It is the most boring airport. Filthy toilets. No info at all about departures - if they are late. You know when the planes are leaving - a lady shouts out. It is a bit of a joke but no waiting time due to the small size of the airport. The AC is not working outside the cafe so it is a bit too hot.
Actually more of a bus stop than an airport. There are no facilities besides a pharmacy and getting through security is pure horror. The whole thing simply looks as if it hasn't had the slightest bit of maintenance since the day it was built.
"Modern facade entry and check-in ok though crowed when large planes are scheduled. However behind the easy border post it gets worse. Only restaurant (rather a shabby bar) before the security check. No refreshment facility after the slow security. So don't go to the airport too early (though the airline will urge you). It's terrible to sit more than an hour on very uncomfortable seats in the departure hall (if any available) or in the bar. European airlines have their own security check before boarding. Arrival is chaotic and terribly crowed if arriving on a larger plane particularly at the baggage claim. Be prepared to ""fight"" you through to the belt while receiving some elbow checks and bruises. Friendly staff."
I live in Valencia and work in the UK and use the round trip service fortnightly and have done so from the beginning with thomsonfly. Although the facilities are small and limited at Coventry this seemed to be reflected in the cheaper flight prices and at the same time suits my needs of a reliable bus service to and from Valencia. But recently I have noticed the flight prices increasing without the offer of discounts for regular flyers with this in mind I have looked elsewhere. Staff at Coventry are polite friendly and helpful but it will be all in vain if you have no customers.
Use the airport regularly and it's great parking facilities are next to the terminal so no need to go on a five mile cross country slog with children in tow nor wait for a packed shuttle boss and try and cram all luggage and children on board. As stated before the airport is small and basic (understatement) but then again I don't use airports to sit in or spend all my holiday money in shops before i even depart the UK something which I think happens at many of the larger airports. A very short walk from the terminal (the interim passenger facility as it is more technically known) to the plane and then you are away on your flight. Coming back is so easy as well the arrivals area is a seperate building from departures. If two planes arrive at the same time then I am under the impression that one has to wait for a short period of time foir the arrivals area to clear. However after disembarking getting through passport control and getting to the baggage claim belt we were waiting for about two minutes and then hey presto the bags started coming through. Again a very short walk to the car park (ever present taxis and an hourly bus service to/from the railway station and city centre are also available) and we were off...home within 30 minutes of landing...at a bigger airport just down the A45 I have been waiting for 30 minutes just for the baggage carousel to start revolving. All in #all it is basic but it does exactly what it says on the tin - it's a building (well two buildings) for passengers getting to or arriving from a city by air - and it does this with minimum of fuss and least amount of time. In some ways it is a good alternative for any inbound passengers wishing to avoid the congested London Airports - the bus to the railway station and frequent trains to the centre of London could have you in the capital very easily. Here's hoping for the new terminal an increase in services and more airlines. I know I shall be a regular user of Coventry Airport and so shall my friends family and colleagues for many years to come.
Flew from Coventry for the second time. We found the trick was to check- in and then go to the café across the road before continuing to departures. (There's nothing there but a little 'shop' and toilets.) Watch out if there's 2+ flights as the limited seating can fill quickly with full flights. No problems with the baggage or staff. Return flight was cancelled however due to 'inappropriate landing facilities' at the airport due to the bad fog. Small airport good in general but could do with some major improvement if there's going to be a big passenger increase.
"This was the first time we had used Coventry Airport to travel to Barcelona. Having been used to departing from the larger airports oh how we laughed!! The porter cabin style check in and the cattle shed style arrivals made us laugh and laugh. The coffee shop was like having a cup of tea in your front room. What fun to be escorted to the plane by the same person who checked us in we wouldn't have been suprised if they had flown the plane too! The only hitch was when we arrived back there was already a flight in we were held on the plane while they found someone to escort us to the so called terminal? We giggled at the thought of someone shouting ""Stan! Can you leave the loo cleaning and get the next lot off the Barcelona flight?"" We will be using Coventry again if only for a good laugh."
I travelled from Coventry to Naples this year and found the airport limited but satisfactory. The checkin area reminded me of the old days with cardboard flight destination signs and this was an area that could be easily changed for the better. The lines crossed each other to the destinations and did cause some friction between customers. The car parking was an experience but again was satisfactory. I do not understand why the local bus companies especially those going to Leamington. Stratford do not call in. On returning the baggage was certainly a LOT better than Birmingham so a plus there. In the departure lounge there was a good choice of food and drink at great prices - no rip off here. Also a small point . The newspapers were out and available from about 0500. Birmingham they are still under wraps at 0600. Good value and friendly. Hope they get permission for the bigger one soon.
Flying in to Tobago airport you will find minimal facilities with x-ray or your baggage being the norm (you'll wait a while for your cases!). The experience when flying back out was underwhelming. The 'check in' area is outside the main building in the heat long queues and staff who are happy to chat to eat other mill about and lack any kind of customer service. You'd expect that 'departures' is open all the time. Nope. Again you have to wait outside with no aircon - just a ceiling mounted fan just outside the entrance - and wait until the staff decide they're ready/bothered to 'open'. The best I can say is that the grunts of communication were followed up by pointing at what you needed to do and where to go. Appalling and very slow. The departure lounge itself has air con but the plastic seats (part of the airport upgrade!) are shockingly uncomfortable. If you want duty free shopping you're limited to a small shop about the size of a single bedroom with vodka rum and a few bits and bobs a perfume/soap shop and souvenir stall with t-shirts keyrings and beach bags. There is a small counter area where you can buy drinks and snacks (this is not Costa). You may be sad to leave Tobago but the airport will encourage you to get on your flight.
By far the worst Caribbean airport I have had the misfortune to ever visit. Arrived with Monarch unfortunately Monarch Cabin crew wrongly advised passengers with children under 18 they only had to fill one immigration form with the child's details on the back (which is what the form says). Having queued for over 90 mins to be told we needed to fill a form for each person multiply that 10 to 15 times on our flight chaos ensued. One fan in that whole arrivals hall had youngsters fainting after the 9 hour flight. When we got past passport control we got to baggage reclaim with the fastest belt I have ever seen (great that allowed quick retrieval of cases) only to join another queue to get our luggage X-rayed the same cases that were x-rayed at Gatwick as we waited the baggage belt overfilled with the passengers from row 16 back to row 40+ on the plane jammed at the exit door and piled into each other causing a jam with no airport staff to be seen a passenger eventually hit the stop button. We eventually got out after 2 hours the airport maybe be able to handle endless ATR-72s from Trinidad but not an A330 and Monarch have been going there since at least 2005 when I was in transit from Grenada. I love the Island but would never come back through the airport where no welcome was given anyone tourist or resident.
I have been once to this airport as others said the place is tiny I wonder how it looks when BA and Virgin are around. Boarding into small propeller planes is already a mess they search your bags at the boarding area even though you have already had your carry-on x-rayed.
I have used Crown Point airport 5 times over the last 6 years and each time I return I pray the airport service has improved. Unfortunately this has not been the case. Customer Service remains a missing module from the staff training. I can only imagine that much training is dedicated to being rude and unhelpful to the weary travellers. The security staff appear to be on a mission on to be as difficult possible searching everyone irrelevant it the metal detector beeps or not. And the words please and thank you devoid from their vocabulary. On my last departure from Crown Point (and it will be my last) two international flights were due to leave within 2 hours of each other. The duty free had no cigarettes and the alcohol was extremely limited. The cafe (charging inflated prices) had no sandwiches and were ill prepared for the demand. Two staff took 5 mins to serve one person with 1 bottle of water. The ladies toilets has three cubicles and a queue to match a bank holiday sale in Harrods. I strongly recommend the management of Crown Point visit somewhere like Thailand to see how you can be efficient and polite. Crown Point International Airport I think not. Good luck if you use it to depart from you will need it with lots and lots of patience.
Arriving at the airport was quick and easy. However trying to leave the island is difficult is not extremely unpleasant. The few shops in the departure lounge were closed when we got through customs. Even though we had plenty of time and were the only 2 people waiting they would not let us go downstairs and get any food or water. They were rude and made it perfectly clear they were annoyed with us. On top of that they kept telling us to stay on one side of the departure area. Just make sure you get whatever food/drink/souvenirs you want before going upstairs to the departure gate.
Outdated tiny airport. If a large plane is either disembarking or embarking the facilities are stretched beyond capacity. The staff are not properly trained and often rude. The Caribbean Airlines flights to Trinidad can be a hit and miss affair and if one if using Tobago Crown Point to transfer from an international flight to a Trinidad bound flight or vice versa be prepared to be told that your flight is overbooked delayed cancelled.
I flew into and out of Crown Point from Frankfurt once flew out of of Tobago to Trinidad and on two other occasions tried to do just that without success. The airport is very small mostly handling flights from and to Trinidad. There are very few amenities inside but most of the crucial ones on the concourse just outside (ATM fast food etc.). The staff at migrations and customs upon arrival was friendly and helpful but flying from Crown Point proved an utter nightmare on two occasions. While international flights are handled relatively smoothly the staff dealing with the short-haul Caribbean Airlines trips to Trinidad was exceptionally incompetent and unhelpful. Several flights were cancelled and at no point were passengers informed of this fact. Time and again long queues formed at the check-in counter which none of the about ten people standing behind this counter believed necessary to attend for three (!) hours. When asked to provide even the most essential information on which to base a decision staff would still not inform us about the cancellation of the flight. In the end we spent one entire day at this airport without being able to fly. By far the most shocking airport experience I have had in many years of travelling compounded by unbelievably rude and unqualified staff. My only advice is to take the ferry when travelling from Tobago to Trinidad.
"Curaçao is an important hub in the Southern Caribbean. In terms of quality of services provided, facilities, friendliness of staff and officials, it doesn't come close to the level of other hubs, e.g. St. Maarten. Although some cosmetic upgrades were made, the facilities are in dire need of modernization. The food courts are a rip off, horrible menu items at exorbitant prices, taking advantage of your misery during long layovers and the usual delays, having no choice, but to purchase inferior nutrition. The air conditioning never seems to work properly and you have to be lucky to even log on to the public wifi. Forget about any business correspondence via email and seeking refuge in the below standard executive lounge. If you can, avoid the airport."
Flew in with AB from DUS. CUR is a small Airport that has drastically improved over the years overall it is looking great for its size. However it is clear the Airport cannot handle the traffic though I suspect This could also be poor planning. IC Flights to DUS and AMS open at the same time. Together with regional flights it's simply too much for the Airport to handle without impact on customer service and comfort. Massive queues everywhere. Check-In Security Immigration Toilets and even at the Shops etc. All because approximately 1000 pax are at the airport at the same time.
Small clean airport quick passport checks and the luggage was arriving quickly. It seems well maintained there is enough place to have a drink or have something to eat.
A total drama in arrivals especially in the afternoon when KLM ArkeFly and Martinair arrive. There is only 1 luggage carrousel and you can imagine the mess. The airbridges often do not work and the paint of the building is already coming of. During rain seazon the whole checkin area is under water. This airport looks nice from the outside but is full of problems from the insite.
Quite cosy and small airport immigration is great and hassle free! There is a nice bar outside with modern dance music you can enjoy a beer and snack before flying. Check-in lines are long - make sure to check-in online to avoid hassle. Tax fee is quite high.
I recently had the pleasure to travel through the new Curacao intl airport. I'm very pleased with the new airport. It is very efficient from the outside it has a beautiful typical Dutch Caribbean facade and there are plenty of shops and cafe's to hang out. Staff is very friendly only the immigration customs could to with a customer service course.
They just built a new departure and arrival building. The departure area is beautiful. The floor were you check in is huge. It’s isn’t hot at all although their isn’t air-conditioning. They designed it so that it’s cool all year round. But they made a huge mistake with the arrival area. For big planes like a Boeing 747-400 they only have one exit on the plane. Our biggest company on Curacao KLM had a Boeing 747-400 flying over from the Netherlands everyday. But now because it takes so long to empty the plane they decided to send a smaller plane. This means less tourists each day. Also the airport raised its airport taxes a few years ago it was only 20 dollars now it’s 32 dollars. Some people may think this isn’t a lot but consider this. One of our own plane companies named DEA also flies to Aruba. A ticked to Aruba costs 62 dollars. In that perspective 32 dollars is a lot for people living on Curacao.
"We were stranded in line for LAN Peru at the Cusco airport. Due to LAN's incompetence, it took over 3 hours for us to talk to someone. Their customer service folks were not able to rebook us, and took forever to deal with each traveling group. Not enough reps were there either. As time wore on the problems with the airport restrooms became aggravated. No toilet paper and at 8pm, no more flushing or washing of hands. They shut off the water! Not enough seating and they had all the doors open so it was freezing. We couldn't get out of line or lose our places. No food or water available after 8:30pm for sale anywhere in the airport. We couldn't leave until we saw the rep so stuck in the freezing cold. Upstairs waiting area being torn up and not enough seating either."
Arrived on a domestic flight. There are five boarding gates. Baggage Reclaim relatively quick and Luggage Tags checked against Baggage Tags before exit into Arrivals hall. There were OK toilets in the Baggage Hall. A reasonable range of shops and support facilities at the airport in the main areas.
Very nice airport with comfortable seats. Unfortunately completely ruined by the sound system which is far too loud. Turn the volume down and you have a decent hotel. Our flight was delayed which led to a horrific time with the screaming women announcing in three languages every few minutes. Louder than a nightclub at times.
Nice new airport very similar to the new airport in Phu Quoc. Clean and spacious with more than adequate food and drink options. Lots of seating. Very helpful staff. Very good ratings overall. The number of people who cannot read the conspicuous no smoking signs in the bathrooms is a bit remarkable given Vietnam's very high literacy rate.
What a pleasurable new modern smart airport built right after the old one which buildings now are used for other purposes. Da Nang airport is located in the middle of town and extremely easy to reach and vacate. It is very effective with clear signage quick check-in fast security easy to find lounges not too many shops good view from glass facades and with all the advantages of being a relatively small airport: everything is within reach in 2 Minutes. VN lounge is good they serve even real food as an alternative to industrial pre-packed food.
Very impressive new airport. Clean spacious and acoustically efficient. Several international carriers are flying into Da Nang these days. Expect DAD to get busier and busier.
The new terminal is clean and airy. It is still basic but fine enough for a small Asian airport. The security process was slow especially when they dealt with Caucasian-looking tourists. However the rest was amazing and there was a helpful tourist information which is quite visible within the security area. As expected most members of staff can only manage very simple English but they were quite helpful. The airport is a stone's throw away from town but walking is not quite possible due to government facilities with armed guards lining the way out from the airport. Taxis are cheap and most use the meter + 15000 dong for airport services.
The new airport a huge improvement from the dated one next door the business class lounge with reasonable amenities from buffet style food and cold beer and juices available from the self serve fridge newspapers in English and free internet available. Comfortable seating with a view to the runway business class check-in very smooth with your own line for security check so no waiting. All in all a well designed modern airport my only gripe is it takes some time waiting for your visa on arrival to process once you get to immigration especially if another flight has arrived there should be more immigration officers on the counters for a smoother flow of passengers.
The airport terminal is new and has everything you would expect from a new set up. Check-in was swift and there were no delays at security. The departure area is light and airy with a glass wall facing out on to the runway. Plenty of seating and a good range of food and drink options plus a few shops.
Quite unbelievable. Flying in from Ho Chi Minh we thought 'this looks like a small airport'. Flying out was quite bizarre. The departure lounge is like a bus station waiting area - granny's curtains at the dirty windows and row after row of hard seats. One counter selling water and snacks. Another selling a few books. TV in the corner blaring away in Vietnamese. Smoking area is the corridor leading to the departure gate for Jetstar's flight to Hanoi. Unkempt and dirty they've obviously given up on the place. Ex-military and you really get the vibe it's for processing only. Thank goodness their new airport next door is almost finished.
Arrived on a VN flight from Saigon. Of course there was a two hour delay arriving in Da Nang at 7:30 with the other VN flight from Saigon we were stuck with a million other people (2 A330's I believe) and only one very slow luggage belt. Took about 25 minutes for my bag to come through and as a high school tour group we had to wait a further 40-45 minutes until the final 3 bags came through. Outside is a mess. Lucky they are building a proper terminal next door to replace the tin shed they currently have.
In a word - horrible! The most positive thing about this airport is it closeness to the CBD - not that Da Nang is a wonderful metropolis either. God help the elderly/wheelchair customers once they check in and have to navigate 3 flights of stairs - no lift access. As previously mentioned you are plonked in a Waiting area with seats and not much else. Obviously a very old airport which has NEVER been updated. No boarding calls made whatsoever - just noticed everyone rushing towards the ticket counter only to walk down 3 more flights of stairs then plonked on a bus to drive you out to the plane.
"Airport is very close to town. Was a US military base and it appears that few changes have been done since the US left (even the US ""welcome"" sign is still on the roof of the original terminal). Check in area looks to be from the US military period. Waiting area is very small. There are no true shops in the departure area only counters like in a department store where a very limited selection of items is on sale. Very limited food and bar service was available. The airport is a big step down from an airport like Tan San Nhat (SGN) in Ho Chi Min City."
Arrived at Danang from Hanoi: terminal basic but luggage quickly arrived and departure from the terminal was quick after a check at the exit of luggage tags. Plenty of taxis available for the short trip into town.
New Year Eve 21.00-23.30 . Standard control and luggage transfer after arrive from Madrid. Chaos and no information about belt. No trolleys. No fresh air. 3 hours for standard control before return flight. 8 passport checks. Police 'confiscating' packed standard AA alkaline batteries left same batteries unpacked. No information in English language. About 30 seats for passengers of 3 flights.
Flew out from Senegal to Madrid. Check in is clean bright and very efficient at the Iberia desk. security was rigorous but very well mannered. Passport control wasn't quick. Airside not too bad range of shops but the cafe sells the worst coffee I have ever drunk. For some reason all European flights take off late at night but save that we took off only 5 minutes late. Been to far worse American airports than this. Promise of a new airport seems some way off but would not be adverse to departing from there again.
"Transiting in Dakar airport from Cape Verde to New York. Bussed in from the plane waited for a while at the space marked ""Transit"" until someone arrived (with some prodding). Then he said I shouldn't go through there (as I had a European passport) I should ""faire le tour"" meaning go through immigration. Anyway he let us in and then someone came to the transfer desk but said ""No we can't do this here you have to 'faire le tour'"". So (luckily have a UK passport so didn't need visa) I filled out the entry form queued up went through immigration and past baggage claim then found a queue to get into the check-in area and a monster crowd around the check-in desks. Happily as I was in business class and had no bags to check and was anyway on transfer they let me by-pass the queues to check in and then by-pass most of the amazing queues for immigration to leave Senegal again. But it still took an astonishing 90 minutes from getting off the bus to arriving back in the departure gate and got to the really comfortable business-class lounge."
Flew in from Joburg on a New York bound flight landed at 2am and was the only English speaking person in the air port. Despite my surfboard being lost and difficulties explaining what a surf board is arrival was fairly easy. Airport very shabby and old looking but this is west africa. Customs was virtually non existent on arrival but strict on departing. Beware of the Taxis and the people offering to change money for you. A taxi to Dakar should cost no more than 8 to 10 cfa dont be conned. Look for a cab away from the entrance near the bus stop (across road on the right side) is your best bet. Don't be harassed and don't get into a taxi with more than the driver onboard. Keep your wits about you.
Fresh breeze with a smell of seaweed that you might experience when you leave the plane. You will then probably end up in a long slowly moving queue for the passport control still dressed in your much-too-warm clothes from Europe. Last time we passed there the area beyond the passport control was crowded and rather chaotic. To pass quietly the customs control without any checking was therefore not so difficult. Travellers not used to African conditions will probably also find the taxi drivers quite difficult to handle
There is a recurring theme here. That is re: the food prices. Simple solution stop paying the prices. Somebody said they had to pay 77 lira  no you didn't but let me guess you did anyway so as to not cause a scene. We never ever buy at the airport the only thing is water which is costly but not as bad as juice etc. The thing I would like to see is more comfortable seating in departures and more seating at departure gates. Apart from that airport is ok better than what it was bearing in mind it was a military airport! All airports are the same re: prices UK is almost as bad with their prices and yet people still pay >£10 for a breakfast crazy.
Clean and not hot when we visited. Queues orderly and efficient. However food exorbitant as previously stated but airport lounge equally poor. Pre purchase tickets online or as before you will be paying extra if pay on the day due to conversion rate. CPE lounge badly run staff out of their depth do not monitor who is using the lounge and unhelpful. Acres of space with no seating. Whoever heard of using a premium lounge and having to sit on the floor. Supposed to be a two hour usage but this arbitrary which increased the seating problem.
"Whoever is responsible for the running of this airport should be fired and replaced by someone has knows how to run a business and give customers what they want. I have never seen such an amateurish airport operation anywhere else in the world. The shops and food outlets are generally empty as the prices are so extortionate. If the prices were realistic sales volume would increase and they would start to make some real profits. As it is they seem be making 100% of nothing. The other reviews already given by others have listed all of its other shortcomings so it's time that the powers-that-be took note and sorted out their act. Turkey and its people are wonderful and it's a shame that many visitors dread passing through this airport. I shall be flying to and from Dalaman yet again in October and it would be nice if the airport operators ""got it"" and made the necessary changes to improve customer expectations and as a consequence increase profits. Shouldn't be difficult. I decided to write this review after considering using the CIP Executive Lounge on my next visit. Usual story - sky-high price and little on offer. I'll be using the hard wooden seats as usual!"
The worst airport I have been to. Re scanning suitcases on arrival I have seen this at another airport but cannot remember where. The prices are the worst I have experienced. Why are the duty free prices in Euros? When they convert them to Turkish Lira the exchange rate is a rip off. The airport was like a sauna no air con going. The seats wooden and very uncomfortable. We were lucky our flight was on time but some peoples flight were 3 hours late. We had a great holiday in a great country where the people were great why spoil it with a disgusting airport.
Anyone flying out of Dalaman should be prepared for extortionate rip off prices in the departure lounge. We had to pay 77 lira (£26) for two cheese sandwiches 2 coffees and 2 small bottles of water. The coffees alone were 14 lira (£4.80) each for a small cardboard cup of rubbish and the sandwiches were 20 lira (£6.80) each. I would suggest that you take food with you and stick to the water.
The airport is 'modern' but basically looks like the inside of a factory or warehouse. Having been in Turkey for a week we were aware that everywhere excepts Stirling so as we had run out of lira we didn't bother converting any more. As such the prices at the airport were even more extortionate! Lastly was the time we had to wait for our visa! Out of about a dozen booths only about 3 were open and we waited over 45 minutes simply to get our visa! They could certainly do with more staff working in this area! Overall the airport is a rip off for tourists and a disgrace to the Turkish people all of whom we met were lovely people.
Not sure what the point of these reviews is if nothing every changes for the better but I concur with other comments about the food prices in the airport. They are indeed extortionate and shouldn't be allowed. My daughter bought a 6 nugget meal and a double cheeseburger at McDonalds and it was 19.40 (she paid in Lira). I know people suggest taking food with you but it wasn't possible to keep it cool on the transfer journey from Hisaronu and drinks need to be discarded anyway. As a result we paid the equivalent of££4 each for a can of coke. If you're travelling with a family you've often not always got a lot of money left on the last day of your holiday and it's important to keep children hydrated but at Dalaman airport I fear a lot of people will end up very thirsty/hungry!
I flew home from Dalaman airport a week ago and have to say I was absolutely disgusted with the pricing for food in the terminal. I don't mind paying 15 euros for a decent meal in a restaurant but£15 euros for fast food such as McDonald's KFC and Burger King is criminal. Air conditioning does need some work / updating. It was such a shame because we really did enjoy our stay in Turkey but this really did leave a bitter taste in my mouth for my return home.
Did not like Dalaman Airport. Check -in took along time. Air conditioning was not turned on. Food and drink was really expensive and the airport was gloomy and dark. So glad I didn't have a delay there because it was also quite a small airport and there wasn't that many shops.
Just flown back from Dalaman airport and it was fine. There was ample comfortable seating air conditioning the staff were pleasant and the check in process relatively quick. We did take our own snacks so didn't have to buy food there. The shops were good and the prices were pretty much comparable to other European airports. Announcements were clear and our flight left before expected time. No complaints!
The prices of food and drink are shocking beyond belief! I can't believe they are allowed to get away with it. These prices need looking into. A great pity because beyond the airport Turkey is a wonderful country. Get rid of the airport management quick before their reputation stops people visiting the Dalaman area.
As per a previous comment flying into Dalaman is a relatively painless experience but flying out is a nightmare. You are herded like cattle spoken to (shouted at) like idiots and then required to take out the equivalent of a mortgage for the privilege of buying a drink before you leave the country. Yesterday I was charged the equivalent of £12 for a cup of coffee and a cheese salad roll (soggy). Also beware if you want to pay in GBP as they conjure up an imaginary exchange rate which is at least 10% lower than normal. I would encourage everyone to take sufficient food to the airport to cover the wait & deny these disgusting money grabbers a single lire or your hard earned cash. Also I would briefly say that the seating is very uncomfortable the staff pretend not to understand if there is any problem and the toilets are diabolical.
Poor air conditioning - too hot - announcements too quiet to hear - baggage offload a joke. The whole place looks unfinished. Staff unfriendly - unlike the country which we love. Food expensive and poor quality. Avoid!
Arriving at Dalaman: Is perfectly fine. Baggage is always pretty much waiting for you the longest we have waited is 10 minutes. The VISA queues can be slow but that is mainly because people don't have the correct money ready. Departing from Dalaman: Absolute joke of a place. We love Turkey and have been 6 times but the one thing I always dread is going home. Rude security. Useless check in staff that can't add up 13 kg + 15 kg does not equal 48 kg! Extortionate prices for food and drink. Useless boarding staff. Need I go on!
Very expensive! Please take some food/drinks with you. In our attempt to get rid of our last remaining Lira we thought we'd use it in the McDonalds (only food place that was open). However we didn't have enough as one meal will set you back over £20! Aside from the expense the Terminal is a new one and is fairly comfortable. Could do with speeding up check-in and security however!
This airport's prices are disgusting - so expensive! I would advise you take your own food! Not enough seats while your waiting at the gates to board you will find it very hot and stuffy and most likely have to end up sitting on the floor! Terminals however are very clean but the toilets are not.
This airport is only interested in getting an extra buck. Last year they charged for excess luggage which we didn't have. This year our allowance was 15 kilos each we bought luggage scales and weighed our case which was well short of the weight but they tried to charge us again for being over weight. Be careful if you use this airport. Price of food drink and duty free is also extortionate.
In and out of Turkey via Dalaman Airport. Every one says expensive so on leaving we took our own food but you have to buy a drink. €3.20 for one tin of Coke - rip-off! Turkish tourist authorities should be investigating the crooks who run this airport. Worse was the toilets - disgusting is a polite description. We used the Ladies and Gents on the way in once and twice each before leaving not a pleasant experience. Each had one electric hand dryer - none working no paper towels in dispenser no soap in any dispensers I used one cubicle - no paper excrement stains under/around seat (obviously never lifted and cleaned properly and allowed to build up as a hard stain). That was our experience across 5 separate WC's. Perhaps two reasons not to visit Turkey via this dump - cost and hygiene. This part of Turkey is now off our list for a revisit!
Personally have never had a problem going in or out of Dalaman. Maybe its the times of arrivals and departures etc. On arrival our luggage is usually coming around by the time we get there only negatives as mentioned before are the food and drink prices but this can be avoided by taking your own food through. The only other thing I don't like is if travelling easyjet they should have an area cordoned off for Speedy Boarders at the moment it is a bun fight to get through the gates. Some people not caring that we have paid for the privilege to get onboard first to choose our seats.
I have flown from Dalaman a few times and never had a plane leave on time. In fairness that's not the fault of the airport but they don't seem to care about stranded passengers. There are hundreds of wooden-slat benches around but they are designed to be impossible to lie on. If you're lucky you can snag a sofa but the rest of us have to lie on the floor - next to nobody uses the benches those that do usually regret it. The food is tremendously expensive. The whole place has an oppressive 'prison' feel about it. The check-in queues are very slow. The gates' seating areas are inadequate instructions and plane updates are woefully lacking. The floor does appear to be fairly clean.
An extremely expensive airport. I love Turkey but when they charge you £10 to go in and rip you off coming out it can leave a bitter taste to your holiday. They even try to get you into trouble at the duty free shop with staff saying you can bring several thousand cigarettes back to UK when you can only bring 200 at duty free. I think long term it will deter people from visiting Turkey.
The one huge negative at Dalaman is the cost of food & drink - £1.60 of 300ml of water or £8 for a McDonalds Burger are indeed indefensible prices. Having said that though I found the airport to be pretty good. Very clear lots of seating fair selection of shops and helpful staff.
Can only agree with what others have said the prices are extremely expensive. If you're travelling to the airport and with TCX or TOM then wait until you're on the coach - the waters are 2 for £1. On your inbound flight bring sandwiches and liquids. Drink it in the area before you get to the gates conditions there aren't good - there is limited seating. Luckily the Manchester flight was the only one running on time people going to Aberdeen had a 2hr delay and Gatwick was 4hrs delayed.
We have just returned from Turkey and would agree with all the comments about the rip off culture at the airport. I would like to warn people not to buy from duty free either. They have a unique system of pricing in Euro and then converting to Lira at check-out. It is much better to buy on the way out. Istanbul is also a very expensive airport (Ataturk). The airlines are now warning people not to buy any food or drink at airport in Dalaman. What a pity to have that awful experience as you leave such a wonderful country.
If your flight is on time you will cope by taking a packed lunch and peanuts etc and your own drinks. Consume drinks at the last minute! If you book your seats and check in online you can afford to go airside as late as possible.
I have been visiting Turkey for many years. The airport staff are rude sullen unhelpful and bear no relation to the wonderful Turkish people I have met on holiday. The management of the bar should be ashamed of themselves. I paid 60 Turkish lira for a glass of wine and a small pringles! There is no justification for these prices.
We've been a few times and Dalaman Airport is an endurance test! It's so at odds with the Turkey - with miserable staff awful food at ridiculous prices and no thought for the poor human beings passing through! We flew home Mid May which isn't a terribly hot time of year but the airport was stifling and uncomfortable. The seating is awful a wooden bar design that is just so uncomfortable for even a few minutes never mind a couple of hours. There aren't enough seats at the departure gates for all on the flight so you'll often end up sat on the floor. It is clean spacious with plenty of clean toilets - but it's just not enough to counteract the sheer misery of the rest of it! Tips : Wear summer clothes with something warmer to change into on the plane or at home. A lot of people leave their drinks at the first scan (at the front door as you go in) but you can keep your drinks at this point and while you check in and until the next scan just before passport control. Once you're through passport control you're only a couple of minutes from your gate so leave it a while before going through so you can drink. Take food with you as everyone says - prices are just stupid. As not many people buy food I'd worry a bit about how long sandwiches have been sitting out! If your luggage may be over your limit you'll be charged by most airlines. Have a look round at empty check in desks as they usually leave their scales switched on so you can check your weight and adjust bags accordingly. If you are delayed or fancy a more pleasant experience check out the VIP lounge (CIP Premium Lounge there). We've not been in but you pay a flat fee (I think 20 Euros) have air con food and drinks newspapers WiFi. It's up by the food court.
Dingy and dull airport. No air conditioning thus very hot and stuffy everywhere. Enormous queue outside the airport just to get in it was chaos and took us about a half an hour just to get into the airport. Why is there a security gate just to get in the airport? The Visa charge is a little bit of a rip-off but I can cope with that. I can't cope with spending £8 just for two milkshakes at McDonalds. Not a child-friendly airport at all I'd try another airport if you have young children. The buses were crammed with far too many people as well I have a mild fear of being in a crowd I can't escape from and it was horrible.
Just in case other people do not know. If you hand a £20.00 or £50.00 note to pay for a visa you will not get change. They will not accept £5.00 so make sure you have the correct note.
The experience at Dalaman airport is the polar opposite of our experience in Turkey. Staff sullen and unhelpful. Prices three times the norm and majority of the food available is of the fast variety - ie. rubbish. All in all a very unpleasant experience. I would seriously avoid this airport at all costs in future and visit Turkey via another airport if possible. Maybe if others do the same they might get the message.
Just arrived back from Turkey via Dalaman Airport - holiday but was ruined by my experience at this airport. Security screening and check in was fine but when they opened the gate for boarding it was absolute chaos. They didn't call for passengers disabled or with children to come forward first. Nor did they call people in certain rows. There were two flights for the same gate 34 and people were confused about which queue to be in as no direction was given. Then they couldn't get buses to take passengers to the plane last call was flashing on the screen and 100's of passengers were still waiting to be transported to the plane. It must have been a frightening experience for elderly and disabled people. I don't think I could face this airport again. Thankfully we did not purchase any food here as we had been warned in advance about the outrageous prices.
Check in queues were long and slow but apart from that things were fine. Plenty of seating (at 4am) - 2 coffees and 2 pastries for £5 (at the departure gate).
The whole administration gives the impression of no organisation. Although I had checked the 5 of us in online we had to stand in the bag drop queue for an hour because they rechecked in everybody in the queue. There were also lots of people in the bag drop queue who had not checked in. Very poor end to a great stay in the area.
How I wish I had read these reviews before going on holiday. Normally my husband and I never go into any airport bar as usually we pick up our car from our arrival airport however because there was 6 of us we had a bus arrangement and due to flight being delayed for over 3 hours thought we would go and have a drink at the bar. Never again 3 pints of lager 2 fantas and a small bottle of water cost Â£49. We were utterly shocked but should have realised the moment we entered the bar as there were only another couple of people there. The prices at the fast food outlets was also extortionate. We had the foresight to take sandwiches and soft drinks with us although had to drink liquids before customs ( wish we had had similar foresight for the airport bar!). The airport was also very stuffy hardly any aircon. I felt so sorry for parents with small children as they would have definitely needed drinks. Also agree with reviews regarding lack of seating downstairs. The airport authorities really need to sort this out. If we go back to Turkey again we will take food and drink and will not go through customs until the last minute. Lovely airport totally spoiled by rip off prices!
The main gripe about the airport is the prices. The airport is clean air conditioned with decent toilet facilities. Take food with you. The authorities have stopped drinks going in so that is a problem. Be prepared know what to expect and should not be a problem.
I wish I had read these comments before my return from Dalaman Airport we are still reeling at the price for 2 pints TL35. How can that be justified. Such a disappointed end to a lovely holiday.
Still the same ridiculous prices for food or something to drink - we were delayed for 6 hours and the security staff tried to stop us going back outside for a cigarette - while they were smoking in front of us! Turkish authorities REALLY need to clamp down on the concessions here - the airport is famous worldwide for rip off prices the infrastructure is pretty bad as well.
It's all been said before - extortionate pricing for food and drinks newspapers too. On the way in the visa official forgot my £10 change too. All rather sad really.
Just back from Turkey today and still reeling from the extortionate prices being charged at Dalaman Airport. What struck me is the stupidity and short sightedness of the management  if they cut their prices by a third they would sell four times as much. Where else can you find McDonalds KFC and Burger King outlets without queues actually with the exception of the absolutely desperate no customers at all? The airlines must love it I have never seen so much food sold on a flight. Refusing to pay the bar prices we bought a nice bottle of red in the duty free shop (£8) and managed to persuade a bar tender to open it for us!
We were disgusted with the prices being charged for very mundane fast food. Whilst we looked at the menu we noticed that there was no queue (a first for MacDonalds) and a large number of people having seen the prices at the tills walked away. Finally the method of paying £10.00 in cash for a bit of paper stuck into our passport which purports to be a visa on arrival feels a bit like a bribe to let us in. If this really is a charge for a visa then add it to the ticket price. Also seriously consider whether young children should be subject to this charge.
There is a restriction on taking liquids through customs. This is when you go through passport control not when you first enter the airport and have to have your luggage scanned - you are fine to take liquids beyond that point just not through to the other side of passport control. Fine to take sandwiches etc just not drinks - so had to pay 5 lira for a 500 ml bottle of water. Noticed this time that there is even less seating than there was at the beginning of the season which means that if you want a seat you have to sit in the food court areas. We did this and kept getting asked if we were going to buy anything. Take something to eat with you but you just have to grin and bear it to pay the price for a drink if you are desperate.
Was there today and will never visit Turkey through this zoo of an airport again. Queue for this queue for that - surly staff and as for the lack of seating on the ground floor forcing you to the first floor to be faced with stupidly high prices for essential food and drink items. Managers of this facility hang your heads in shame!!
We just flew back from Dalaman airport and although we had 2 hours to kill we refused pay their ridiculously high prices for food and drink. There are several high street companies ie MDs Burger King but they all charge these high prices - it must be price fixing or bordering on some illegal practice. Coffee is around £4.50 and even a bottle of water will cost around Â£4. Very few people were buying and it's leave visitors with a bad feeling of the place so it makes you wonder what their game is.
Have been going to Turkey for 15 years and it's a shame that the last memory of a wonderful country is spoiled by such a rip off at the airport. Food and drink prices are sky high. My advice would be to take food and drink with you. There is no restriction in place at the moment for taking water etc through customs. There is plenty of seating in the food halls and I have never been had any problems when eating food not bought there. The airport is stuffy and dim and the public announcement system is impossible to understand.
Arrivals perfect but passport control were very rude - just throw your passport at you then take a tenner off you. Way home was horrendous we had about 1-2 hour delay we had to sit on the floor as poor seating. Everything there was a rip of didn't even bother going in the shops as read previous reviews saying rip off.
What an absolute disgrace! I got fleeced 40 lire (£18) for two beers and a small tin of pringles! Nowhere to sit poorly lit escalators designed to try and keep you spending (by being laid out the wrong way round) the whole place is a complete living nightmare made worst when you are delayed (which is a near certainty).
"I agree with all the previous comments about the rip-off prices at this airport. Last year Burger King landside wanted TL28 for a bacon double cheeseburger - not the meal just the sandwich! This year (2009) that BK was closed. Airside the rip-off continues. A cheeseburger at McDonalds is around Â£10 and Â£40 for a family of four would be about average. The airport is new and clean. There is very little seating except in the food areas. It is easy to get to the food areas up an escalator but there is no ""down"" escalator nearby. to get back to the ground floor and the gates involves a long walk to the othere end of the terminal and back. Poor design!"
"I agree with all that has been said about the extortionate prices that passengers are expected to pay for very ordinary food and drink at this airport. I was asked to pay 46 lira for 3 can of coke and a packet of Pringles. This whole pricing issue is a shame because my experience in Turkey was generally of very reasonable prices . I was left with such a ""sour taste"" because we had a very long wait at the airport and would have like a decent meal at an acceptable price. Even a burger king burger was 26 lira. Turkey should take notice that on this basis alone I would veto their application for EU membership"
Do not think I am adding anything new here but just to underline what everybody else has said. If you are unfortunate to get stuck at Dalaman Airport like we were (for 13 hours) make sure you have a credit card with you to pay for your food and drink. 6 of us needed to eat something. KFC. Macdonalds Pizza Express etc all roughly the same price - GBP 10 per head! There were 6 of us we bought 6 meals at KFC and it cost TL135 = GBP60.00. Amazing how they can get away with it.
Same comment as everyone else. Outrageous prices limited seating despite being a new airport it was dull. The staff resent being there and all in all a poor end to a fantastic holiday. To get a seat we went into the pub at the end for a meal and drink. Same comment really outrageous prices and the staff seemed more intent on shouting across the bar to each other than serving their customers. Food in the bar was disgraceful particularly as we had been used to fabulous food in Kalkan. I'll be making sure any friends of mine going there don't get caught out like we did. The Airport authorities should be ashamed of themselves.
I agree totally with all the comments people have submitted to this site - having experienced in the past severe delays at Dalaman (aircraft problems) - I expect by now we holidaymakers have paid off the national debt of Turkey. Having been an ill-fated passenger of XL last year my colleague and I were faced with a six hour wait at the airport before we were flown home. We had not yet checked in so discovered the cafe in the coach park - whilst not cheap we whiled away many hours at half the cost of being inside the terminal.
"Staff speak very poor English; not the ideal situation when going through security - especially when they seem frustrated at you for their lapse in communication and not yours. Staff generally miserable customer service poor - at passport check in I had my passport snatched and chucked back at me was stripped of £10 for a visa which nobody had been warned about and was completely disregarded throughout the entire process. This in combination with a dull concrete roofing and dim lighting makes for a somewhat depressing experience. Prices are ridiculous. The 'cool zone' shop was selling a normal pack of pringles for £10 when I asked ""You think that's cool"" whilst referencing the shop name and pointing at the packet was abruptly threatened with a call to the police - for simply questioning the price of a beverage that shouldn't have been more than £1.50. This was made somewhat worse when either parents were forced to empty their pockets to feed or water a young child (£4.00 / 500ml bottle of water) or they simply went without for which Turkish authorities in the airport should be utterly ashamed. This pricing left a sour taste in my mouth as the holiday came to a close - and very effectively summed up Turkey's financially taxing culture hidden charges and nothing - for free culture - which even bites when you've paid the admission fees. The whole experience made me realise how good Gatwick airport really is."
Yes the airport is very expensive it was 25 TL for a meal at Kentucky Friend Chicken or MacDonalds very expensive. We knew about this and still ended up buying rolls and drinks which for 4 rolls and drinks worked out not as expensive but still not cheap. You can take bottled water through Customs so buy it before you get to the airport. Also a good point to let you know which a friend did me is you have to pay a £10.00 english note for each passenger to get into the country so take it with you as its a pest when you get there.b The airport is very clean and cool and the toilets were clean so it was fine just don't eat there.
Cannot agree more that the prices of refreshments in Turkish airports are far too high and likely to leave a bad taste in any traveller's mouth!
Pity the first time visitor to Turkey - this is their last memory of a beautiful country! The airport practice of being a complete rip off remains. 8TL (£3+) for a can of pop bearing in mind that they practice a liquid restriction (though we saw evidence to belie this) what kind of profit is this airport now making? Check-in staff were friendly but just not quick enough. The airport was unbearably hot. Entrance scanner staff must have felt that they needed something to do as I was asked to unpack a camcorder and produce passports. Duty Free prices are all in Euros so you can bet your life that you are being fleeced due to a dynamic currency conversion. Having paid more than double UK service station prices for food before we avoided the food court. Smoking restrictions are in place but we couldnt face the journey through the scanners a 2nd time round. A modern building with the capability of being outstanding - what a shame it isn't put to use!
Dalaman airport so expensive - Mcdonalds Burger £12 Crisps £4 Coffee £4 KFC bucket £37 etc. Bottle of Water £4. Beware of the trolley scam They offer a trolley at the main glass door as you get out of your taxi and charge you £1 (2TL) for a 20 yard walk to the check in. Turkey should be ashamed of this rip off. The people and culture is fantastic. There is a VIP lounge called a CIP goodness knows what they charge no surprise there were no people using it. So take drinks and food as you will get delayed in the summer and £50 for 4 burgers is hard to swallow !
For a new airport it is very disappointing. The check in and security is OK but once you are in the departure lounge it is really awful. The food outlets are horrendously expensive (take sandwiches is my advice). But most importantly there are hardly any seats in the whole departure lounge. If you dont want to go into the restaurants (and only a very rich or mad person would do this) you have to sit on the marble floor until your flight is called.
Disgusting. No other word for it. Food and drink prices are nothing short of extortion and those interested in attracting tourism to Turkey should do something about it. Airport dark and dingy. Very uncomfortable and worst of all its a new. The best thing about this place is the lost and found place. We left our camera on the plane by accident and they were very good at getting it sorted out for us. As an experience though it definitely the worst of the worst. Best avoided if you can.
A lovely airport with friendly staff just a great pity management have decided to fleece parting tourists after what was possibly a very enjoyable Turkish holiday experience. Whether you have a coffee a coke a beer or a packet of crisps everything costs £4! Our group had 4 coffee's = £16 ridiculous! We saw many embarassed and obviously thirsty families having to turn down refreshments which they had ordered but did not have the money left to pay for. Just pray you never have a lengthy delay of your flight at Dalaman Airport! Tip - there appears to not be a 100ml restriction (as there is in the UK) at security so make sure you take plenty liquid in with you. Because of this we have given what is otherwise an excellent airport one star.
Arrived in the domestic section in the evening. Bags out quickly no matching of the bag-tag to the baggage receipt as can be the case in other airports. Left on the international side the following morning. Check-in reasonably quick. No waiting for passport control. Security check also quick though followed up by a pat-down. Once airside the food options are limited. The small smoky cafe served very expensive filter coffee at 38RMB (espresso machine broken) but the Udon noodles at 40RMB were excellent. Shopping limited. The Terminal is bright nice and airy though fairly small - only five gates in the international section. When taxiing you get a nice view of the military airport the closest foreigners will get to seeing chinese airforce planes.
Excellent airport with ample space and good architecture. Check-in very efficient. Immigration officers very friendly because now there is a small machine on the left side with which you can evaluate the service of service of the officer from poor to excellent in 5 grades. It is true that it doubles as a military airport but you could have a rare sight of military jets standing nearby.
Dalian Airport is ok. It is a large “new” terminal now with both the old and new buildings not exactly seamlessly combined. Check in for both domestic and international flights is straight forward. Look at the departure board and go to the appropriate window. Security is also easy. Don’t put your ticket away as they need to see it along with your passport and boarding pass. Delays are common due to the bad weather in the area- seems to me they built the airport in the foggiest part of the city. High winds also cause problems and the fact the civil airport doubles as a military base means there is no prize for guessing who gets priority. Don’t go there hungry or you will have to pay high prices for average Chinese or Korean food. The usual snack shops are plentiful but expect to pay for it. Toilets are bearable but (as with all toilets in China) don’t forget to take some paper from the dispenser near the wash area as there is none provided in the individuals cubicles. I guess they think you will steal it if they leave you alone with it long enough. Despite the smoking rooms provided Chinese still insist on smoking in the toilets so you have to put up with that discomfort too.
"The Airport which is going under a renovation program called the TRIP. But the airport is still very good, the SkyLink which connects the terminals is very clean and fast. The terminals are all up to date and my trip was pleasant."
"We all expect lines at the airport to be long and tedious but when it gets confusing, your stress level will get the best of you. There were plenty of agents at the time to assist travelers yet every 10 feet had an agent checking your ticket yet when I get to the front of the line, we were left with no agents directing anyone through 1 of 6 lines. We were told to pick whichever line but wasn't informed that only half of them had working scanners therefore we must combine 2 lines into 1. What was the point? There was a drug dog that made it hard to squeeze through the line. Why couldn't they have the dog be outside of the line and sniff as everyone past it? Among all other airlines I've been to, (Chicago, New York, Tampa, Seattle) DFW has gotten worse over the years."
"This airport is one that I refuse to fly into again. I was iffy about flying American Airlines to begin with, but knowing how their main hub of an airport is, I will never be visiting again. When landing in DFW for a layover, we had to taxi for 20 minutes because the control tower miscommunicated what gate we belonged to. Certain terminals are very nice with nice restaurants and waiting areas, while others are the underground tunnels of construction and uncleanliness. If coming through this airport be prepared to walk to anything and everything. The tram system is nice, however, the restaurants and gates can be up to a 10 minute walk away. When departing to our destination, we once more taxied on the runway for 20 minutes with a full flight and no little to no air-conditioning circulating as it was 95 degrees outside. When coming into Dallas for the layover returning home, seconds from touching down, we suddenly began to speed up and take off into the air. After 5-10 minutes after being in the air, the pilot came on the intercom and said the runway had traffic, and we are circling around. After the commotion of the flight, we waited around for our next fight, and never realized until 10 minutes prior to boarding that our gates changed to a completely different terminal. Lastly (there is no surprise to this one), we had to wait around 15 minutes for Dallas to transport half of the missing luggage from the other side of the airport. Needless to say, this was an awful experience. If you have the option of going to a different airport, take it, because, this airport/control tower needs to get it together, or they will be the next ones in the news headlines from airplane miscommunications."
"I would never imagine that baggage trolleys can be a paid luxury. 5 bucks for a trolley, and no trolleys whatsoever available inside security. In the worlds 4th busiest airport? This alone is enough to swear to never again fly through DFW. Nice eateries and shops did not make up for this ridiculous trolley policy. Dallas Fort Worth - no more."
If your flight uses this airport as a transfer option I would recommend you avoid like the plague! Choose another transfer airport even if the flight cost an extra £100 it will be worth every penny believe me. Security were on some kind of power trip and were very rude. Staff have absolutely no interest in anything you have to say unless it's to do with American Airlines. No direction signs at all for connecting flights you have to find your own way. Dallas Fort Worth you were our first impression of the USA - not a good impression.
We just had a terrible experience at DFW. My husband is handicapped and had requested wheelchair assistance. A wheelchair was waiting for us on the exit ramp but no wheelchair pusher. We two aged 70 and 84 had to manage ourselves and our carryon luggage through customs then pick up our checked baggage recheck it and go back through security to the Skyline and to our connecting gate having never been assisted by an official wheelchair pusher. We received random brief help from airport staff or other travelers. We had 3 hours from when our plane from MX landed and when our connecting flight left and we had no chance to use the restroom let alone get something to eat. When we were at TSA a worker commented that all the motorized cart drivers take break at the same time. That is why we had to go to the elevated train to travel the long distance to our next gate. What kind of customer service is this?
Arrived from Australia 20 February 2015 - worst part was waiting 20 minutes for our luggage to arrive. Overall entering the US took about 30 minutes from leaving the plane to completing Customs - not bad I suppose. Connecting flight to Atlanta was uneventful. Overall - DFW is a clean modern and very large airport.
Arrived DFW Sat 17th January 2015 to find now you have choices. Being from the UK you can now go through ESTA channel. It takes about 2-3 mins to process your passport and answer some questions you get a slip of paper with your photo on it present that to a immigration officer then through to baggage. My bags were already waiting for me. Now there are three areas for customs. I entered the ESTA gate and through you go. For me no more than 10-15 mins from Immigration bags and Customs. Something that should have been done years ago has finally arrived. I have been coming to the US through DFW since 2000.
I have now changed flights here on several occasions. It is best avoided - immigration is very slow security is dreadfully crowded/inefficient and the inter terminal transit is slow. Allow at least 3 hours for this. On the plus side BA/AA help with transfers when they can and there are lots of bars and restaurants if you miss your connecting flight (very likely).
Five gate changes in two hours is unacceptable. Even with skylink I was exhausted. Had to catch skylink three times to keep up with the gate changes. It seems to me that it is just short of a controlled chaos. Someone there doesn't know what they are doing or is unable to control what is going on. Could not find anyone that could explain why there are so many gate changes. The flight assistants I talked with even thought it a joke. I will no time in the future go to DFW. Hard to accept this concept without even a simple explanation other than the gate changes DFW is pretty nice to go through.
"I have arrived at DFW twice this year on flights coming back from Mexico City (once in January and once in December). I will only recount my second experience as the two were very similar. As opposed to other reviewers it appears that my flight was the only one arriving at that time. At least I didn't have a mob of angry fellow passengers to contend with. So when you get to passport control you will likely find a lady that smiles at you but doesn't do much of anything else. Once you figure out on your own how to use the machines for automated processing you'll get a piece of paper back from the machine. If your has an X on it that's bad. After finding the path out of the area where these machines are you will run into another lady whose native language is not English who if you ask for information will not be very helpful but if you try to go to the next step without getting her approval will tell you that you need to stop and wait for her (so damned if you do and damned if you don't). Since my little piece of paper had an X on it she pointed me towards the CBP counters (you have to wind your way in the opposite direction of how you came in). There was no one manning the counter she sent me to. Two more people arrived behind me. This lady and I could still see each other. I wanted to yell that there was no agent but was afraid of incurring the wrath of the best and brightest at Customs and Border Protection. Finally she came over to take a look. Just when I though she was about to take some kind of action all she did was yell at another woman working on the side for non-US citizens to take us ""somewhere else."" At this point finally an agent comes to man the counter. This gentleman was visibly fed up and not happy to be there. Maybe that was not such a bad thing because he clearly wanted to be done with me as soon as possible so he asked me a couple of questions didn't really wait for me to answer and waved me away. When I got to customs one agent only was working. There was another agent but he was just sitting there drinking water and watching the world go by. What bothers me is that almost a year later the experience was almost exactly the same. I'm not a fan of self- service passport control. Since humans will still need to be involved. What's the point? It probably only makes the CBP agents feel like they will be replaced by machines soon which will have a detrimental effect on their already less-than-stellar attitude. I forgot to mention both times there was a group of CBP agents talking and laughing in the back while travelers were trying to figure out what to do. So other than portraying Texas (and the US) in a terrible light I don't know what else the international arrivals process at DFW accomplishes. Again I'm only glad there weren't multiple flights arriving at the same time. However since I was sent to a queue no one was manning I still have to say the queuing was unacceptable. I will say the terminal was clean and looks modern but faced with everything else I will avoid DFW in the future (and consequently American Airlines as well)."
"Have arrived at many US airports from international flights and this will be the first and last at Dallas. As the previous poster stated you will need at least 3 hours if you have a connection to make. Arrived after 10 hr flight from LHR and queued for the automated immigration terminal which is completely useless and irrelevant as you will then need to queue to see an immigration officer (circa 1 hour) collect bags and then on this occasion there was 1 officer for customs serving at least 3 international flights. Absolute chaos people panicking to make connections pushing in staff completely unhelpful with the standard ""you will be rebooked if you miss your connection"" took me 3 hours to get through. Why they don't have an express lane for people with connections is beyond me this is a hub isnt it?? I'd say 90% of people arriving Dallas is not their final destination. Never again I do wonder if the airlines have any say at this airport as there is an impact on their business as well. Love the states but never Dallas regards immigration for me."
This would have had to have been my worst airport experience in 40yrs of International Travel. The staff co-ordinating the customs/border control area were hapless to say the least. There were only 3 desks out of 20-30 open. The airport would have been fully aware many hours in advance that 6 international flights were arriving in a similar time frame yet did nothing to alleviate the congestion. Many people missed their connections. DFW was recently lauded in local/national and international news for having the newest technology to process travellers faster. Well I can tell you that there a few airports (incl LAX) that are slower than DFW.
After a long flight from LHR we were met with queues queues queues and unhelpful staff. Not the best impression for an international entry point for the USA. Do not even attempt to make a connecting flight with under 3 hours to spare. We had to queue 25 mins for an automatic passport check queued 20 minutes to see an immigration official then picked up luggage then queued again to someone to check our reason for visiting rechecked bags then had to clear security again (more queuing). On top of that the boarding cards from LHR didn't work so we were sent back to the American Airlines desk to be reissued new ones. Until we got to a gate staff were almost universally unhelpful (we were told by all that we had time to make our flight easily). American airlines blame the airport and take no responsibility for the systematic chaos and the airport staff apparently don't get any feedback that people are missing their flights because of the queuing. We missed our flight to SLC were put on standby for the next one late at night were booked onto one the following day in the end which was cancelled when we arrived at the airport the next morning. Not to mention last minute gate changes causing havoc and confusion for passengers. We did get to SLC in the end having been issued 5 separate lots of boarding cards. The journey back through DFW was much easier but from other reviews it sounds like our experience of entering at this airport is not unusual. Next time we will clear immigration stay overnight than tackle the internal flights the next day. Seems like the only sensible way with kids in tow.
We recently went from Lubbock to Miami via Dallas/Ft. Worth on American Airlines. Dallas is one of the best airports I've been to. The American Airlines Terminal A is very new very modern has lots of food and retail options and is very uncrowded. The half-circle layout of the terminal was excellent because it doesn't take forever to get from one gate to another. The Skylink stops are very convenient and there are 2-3 in each terminal it's a good way to get from one terminal to the other without taking a bus. Our flight to Miami was out of Terminal C another very modern very clean terminal. Overall a nice airport serving the Dallas area.
Excellent Airport though terrible for connecting flight or even entering Dallas for that matter. The facilities are great excellent choice of shopping and restaurants sky train is great and gives a good view of the airport. Customs is a nightmare if there are so many international flights arriving why isn't there staff at customs had to connect to a flight to Mexico and had 4 hours though it took close to 3 hours to get through customs so that I could pick up my luggage and then re-check in the luggage and go once more through security Why they don't have a section for people connecting to other flights is beyond me I was not interested in going out of the terminal then re-entering it. It is a disgrace and Authorities must make sure all customs booths have staff when international aircraft's arrive.
After 10 hr plus flight from LHR on a pretty full B773 was surprised that only 4 booths out of a long line of booths were open to be fair I got through in about 25 mins but I was right at the front of the queues but I really did feel sorry for the rest of the people behind me it wasn't going to be a fun experience for them-once passed INS/Customs there are loads of places to shop eat and drink prior to connecting with onward flight on the day I arrived DFW had a very bad storm (not their fault) which halted the rail so had to walk from D-A which took about 25mins-at all times all airport staff were approachable friendly and helpful.
Transited here after many years of avoiding this airport and its main carrier (American). The good - it's better than it was in the past. Baggage claim is convenient to your arrival gate (for domestic). At some but not all gates you can avoid CNN which is an unfortunate mind numbing part of many US airports. They have a train system although it's no help if you arrive at Concourse D and depart from C (you'd have to do the whole loop or walk which is simpler). The bad - the food selection is awful. Many eateries but mostly the same chains over and over. Packaged snacks and drinks seem expensive even for an airport. Almost nothing is healthy other than pre-packaged salads (which may be a day or so old sandwiches can hang around longer judging from the pull dates). The departure screens seem few in number and randomly placed. Some areas are simply poorly designed. There is a section of the D concourse around the middle where it's easy to get lost despite the relatively small space.
Jan 2014 - arrived on delayed BA flight to be confronted with immigration queue that filled the arrivals hall and only 4 desks open. No help for those with connecting flights - ours missed. 1.5 hours to get to desk then further hour to get through baggage and further 40 mins to re-check flights. What a poor impression. Why oh why does the US not have a transit lounge for those with connecting flights. We await with trepidation our return flight to UK via Miami but will not willingly transit or even visit US again until this fiasco of a system is sorted out.
Last week I flew through DFW from London Heathrow to make a connection to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. Having read reviews on this site I was somewhat apprehensive about making a 2.5 hour connection. I have to say my experience was extremely positive. US immigration took about 5 minutes security another 5 or 6 minutes. American Airlines had tagged my baggage straight through from the UK to Mexico so all I had to do was present a completed customs form but not my baggage. I had more than enough time to make my connection. And all in one terminal - D - a pleasant and well-organised terminal. This was a much better experience than transferring at Mexico City.
Going through customs is a nightmare. No one there to provide directions so you have to figure out for yourself which lines to stand in. There's a computerized system when you get to the front of the line. From there you either go through another customs official search or a briefer process. Seems like a random process and again no one there to answer questions. People around me were getting worked up because they were missing their connections. We just let them cut to the front of the line so they could get through. It's embarrassing to have this be an entry point into the USA!
Arrived on a delayed 10 hour British Airways flight from London. Upon landing had 2 hours to connect onto a flight to Kansas. Immigration took around 25 minutes to clear upon entering the baggage hall met with a snaking queue that wrapped itself around the baggage carousels. This whole process took around 50 minutes to clear customs. Rude unhelpful staff directing passengers. We then had to navigate the TSA transit security no smiles thank you's and surely rude staff and another delay of 35 minutes. We made our connecting flight with minutes to spare tired and totally stressed out. Will totally avoid this shambles of an airport again if on a connecting flight.
It seems that the airport was more efficient several months ago than present date. Early in summer baggage claim was very efficient as was the car toll. At present the new car toll has been a mess from gates not working to very narrow driving areas going into the gate to overcharging. Personally I haven't been overcharged. I was bragging about the efficiency of the airport from how passengers can be delivered right to their departure gate however this is no longer true if leaving from terminal E. Also bragged about baggage wait being very short however just picked up my husband and it took 55 minutes from when he landed to getting baggage. I'm not certain what has changed but it appears it isn't for the best. So sorry to have to report this.
Travelled through Dallas twice in the last 18 months. Worst queues I have ever experienced. Last year following the cancellation of 200 flights due to bad weather I spent 10 hours standing in 3 queues to get re-ticketed. Last month I travelled with 4 hour lay over between flights and needed every minute as immigration was 1.5 hours and the queue to exit with baggage was another 1.5 hours. I will never travel through Dallas again unless there is no other choice.
Immigration very poor 3 hrs in June this time even 5 hrs. 4 counters open for several hundred passengers that is no customer service. Who are the bunch of people that stand around there wearing important badges and faces doing nothing? Avoid this immigration or better the entire AP.
Arrived in DFW from LHR with a connection to SDF what a nightmare it took over 2.5 hours to clear immigration and then another 45 mins to get through customs with another 35 mins to get through security again. Avoid DFW at all cost if you have to transit in the us! They have 60 booths for immigration when I went through they only had 3 open for non US Residents which is not a great impression when arriving into the US. So many people were getting very angry about missing their connecting flights and the people on duty to assist with passengers who had tight connections spent most of their time talking to each other! I would really have thought that after building a new international terminal at DFW they would ensure that the passenger experience would be a great experience but I am sorry to say that DFW is far from it. The staff in immigration are rude and have a lot of attitude the airlines are aware of the situation when you speak to staff but they say there is nothing they can do about it. So if you want a stress free entry point into the US do not use DFW and avoid it at all costs. Needless to say I made my connection with ten mins and they were boarding the flight as I arrived at the gate.
On arrival the airport seemed unlike many other American airports - clean and tidy and judging by other reviews we seem to have done well and got through immigration in an hour plus customs was fairly quick as well. On the way home being British it always amuses us that unlike European airports where the terminal is a really shopping mall with an airport attached American airports are really a food court with an airport attached! To sum up there plenty of places to eat.
I changed planes here yesterday after a holiday in Costa Rica. It was a complete nightmare. We had a 3 hour layover period and only just made the flight back to Heathrow. The queues for Customs and immigration were ridiculous. Surely they could provide a fast track for people with connecting flights! I will never change planes in the US ever again and would probably not consider visiting the USA due to the airports. We changed in Miami on the way out and passports took longer although Customs was quicker.
Landed from Brisbane on Qantas with an overnight stay in the airport Hyatt en route to Montego Bay Jamaica. Immigration queues were poorly managed and very understaffed. It took two hours to clear immigration and another hour to exit the baggage and customs hall. Checking in the next morning (business class) took 90minutes. I changed my flights on the way back through Dallas because I realized my original connection time of just over two hours was impossible. There is no international sterile zone. So arriving from Jamaica required clearing immigration customs collecting bags re-checking and re-entering security. Allow 4 hours. LAX for all its flaws is better.
Frequently travel to DFW from the UK nearly always arrive after a 10 hour flight having already been up for at least 5 hours prior to the flight. Very tired and then met by long immigration queues. They have lots of booths but usually only around 6-8 staff covering them surely they know the periods when lots of flights are arriving at once and can have staff to cover. My daughter at this present moment is stuck in such a queue not even into the immigration hall having already been up for 17 hours will not be through immigrations for another 2/3 hours and then has a 2 hour drive on her own with a very cranky 2 year old. Not good enough DFW - used to be a pleasant experience - not any more!
2 hours to get through customs after a 10 hour flight and that was just normal procedure without getting searched etc. Many people in the queue distraught about missing their connecting flights but all were told not to worry they could rebook so obviously this type of delay is unexceptional/routine.
3 hour stop over and not a hope of catching the one flight to Fort Myers. Totally unresponsive staff resulted in a 20 hour wait for the next flight. We have 7 of us doing the same in August and we are dreading it.
If you are making a connection from an international flight allow at least 3 hrs to catch your next flight. It takes around 60-90 min for immigration alone. They have 8 or 10 booths but I have never seen more than 4 open. Then another 30-60 min to get your luggage back through to your connection. My last lay over there was 3.5 hrs and I almost missed my flight and my luggage did not make the connection. Huge airport that is very very understaffed all of the time. The staff they do have is mostly clueless so if you need advice I recommend asking one of the Airline Representatives who are much more friendly and helpful. If you need a rest break catch one before the departure gates the ones there are usually completely trashed and disgusting. One positive is the Tram is nice but they need it as it is a very long way between gates.
2 hrs to go through immigration and I was in transit. There were 60 booths and only 9 had agents. Had to go through customs and security check only to get back into the terminal. I thought LAX was bad but this is ridiculous.
Stayed at the Hyatt in Terminal D specifically to make our 5.15 am flight only problem is they offer no terminal OR SKYLINK until 4.30am even though a kind service personnel called for a bus we missed our flight. No sense staying at the Hyatt in terminal D if you've got an early flight out of any terminal except D.
Flew into DFW from Sydney last month on a Qantas 747 with the intentions of comparing it to the other common gateway for similar travels Los Angeles International which I had used on the previous 4 trips across the Pacific. The perceived advantage that Dallas has over LAX is that it places travellers like me geographically closer to my final destination of New York City. After weighing all of the positives and negatives this is the only real edge that I experienced. Immigration took longer at Dallas than any of my prior trips through LAX. DFW had plenty of immigration lanes but unfortunately a very large percentage were closed. My craft certainly was not the only international jumbo on the ground at the time either. People sometimes complain about the supposed hassles of connecting at LAX but again the process took longer at DFW than it ever had at LAX for me. Yes you have to exit and then re-enter the terminal after the international flight here just as you do in Los Angeles. Maybe Dallas' airport light rail is more comfortable and easier with luggage than the internal bus system that Los Angeles has but not really enough to sway me. The real disadvantage for now is the fact that DFW does not have the physical infrastructure to handle the large A380 Airbus which is a leap above the Boeing 747 in many aspects. Until that changes it is really back to LAX for my travels.
Huge airport but very easy to get around. Skytram is inside security so 10 minutes or so to get from the two most distanced terminals. I switched from C to A so took all of 4 minutes once tram arrived. Easy to get to well marked. It is a very busy airport but lots of services. Fairly clean consider how busy. Too bad LA or NYC airports don't follow this example.
This airport is absolutely enormous. It is very far from one terminal to the next. Both the monorail system (Skytrain) and the Terminal Link bus convey passengers to the different terminals. The terminals themselves are very nice and modern. Security screening involved lengthy lines although passengers in wheelchairs get priority. Unfortunately all the food outlets are airside so it is necessary to go through security screening before getting something to eat or if you are exiting the terminal you must get your food before you leave the airside area and take it out with you. Unlike airports in Asia there are no smoking kiosks near the gates
While a lot of walking was involved form our plane to Immigration once we got to the agents the process went very quickly. Almost no wait. Customs quick too. Modern American Airlines Admirals Club. Overall a spacious airport. Signage for the tram can be a bit confusing (when we later landed at Terminal C it didn't really seem to matter which tram we took to the international terminal) but overall a good airport. It does apparently experience weather delays at least in the summer. The night before we arrived flights were delayed for hours by thunderstorms.
DFW has 5 terminals ABCD and E. D Terminal is the international terminal is very nice and has many shops and eating establishments parking for terminal D is great with that said ABC and E are not very nice small ales and sitting areas with very few power outlets for travels. The seating itself is old and stained. The most frustrating is the parking the multi level parking garages have no elevators so if you park in the upper levels you must carry your luggage up and down very narrow stairs. Security lines are often long and no on seems to be in hurry. Driving to the airport is offend very congestive and difficult to get in or out areas of the airport. I live in the Dallas area and travel out of this airport almost every week.
"Arrived from Los Cabo to DFW and had a 2 hour lay-over before my American Airlines Connection to New York LGA. First of all we were greeted by a long winding line at the immigration counter where there were just 6 officers! The lines moved slowly and painfully. I tried to persuade security officers to let me go ahead in the line but was met with a firm ""There are plenty of flights to New York it is ok to miss this one! You are ok!"" I have been to several immigration counters - DFW was the worst! After 90 minutes to finally clear immigration and another 10 minutes to clear customs we rushed to the AA boarding gate. Before we could get anywhere close to our gate we had to go through a security and body scan. Another painful 55 minutes followed. I could see many other passengers frantic and anxious in the line. I would make it at least 15 passengers within earshot in the line who had already missed their connections."
This was a great airport from an Australian perspective. Everything was clean and the mono rail was fantastic. There was plenty of shopping and food outlets. The main newer terminal is fantastic.
If it was possible to give negative points for this airport I would do it. I arrived from Cancun on Tuesday April 24th with a 3.5 hour layover until my connecting flight. I thought I had plenty of time to make that flight until I had to wait over 2 hours in the immigration line another 30 minutes in customs line and 45 minutes in security line - not to mention the 10 minutes it took to get from Terminal D to Terminal C on the tram. There were approximately 1000 people in the immigration line (that's just US citizen/residents line) and a grand total of 4 people working the immigration booths as well as only 1 security line. Government inefficiency at its best. Suffice it to say I will never fly through DFW again.
I have never dealt with the kind of ridiculous delays that I experienced at DFW last Wednesday April 11. I arrived from Guadalajara at 10 am. I got to the customs/immigration line a few minutes later and waited 90 minutes to get through customs. After that I waited another 15 minutes to hand in my card to another customs official. In all it took me 2 hours to go from one gate in Terminal D to another gate about 50 yards away.
Very impressed with this airport. Connections are made extremely easy by the sky link tram system which connects all terminals and runs every 3 mins or so. Since DFW has seven runways there were no delays due to runway congestion. My only complaint was the lack of aesthetic appeal in A/C terminals. Terminal D on the other hand was very nice.
The terminal design is such that you can pass from gate to kerb in under 5 minutes upon arrival and security queues tend to be short and manageable upon departure. American dominates the airport and takes up 4 terminals - if you're making a connection between A/C and B/D (on opposite sides of the central highway) it can take a while because the SkyTrain is slow and makes many stops. Terminal D was recently renovated and is quite smart but A B and C are older and could use a refurb. Dining options are outstanding in D but mediocre in A B and C. For whatever reason the airport operators crank up the aircon at all hours and the terminals feel unnecessarily cold. The rental car facility is about 2.5 miles off site but shuttles are frequent.
While it cannot compare to most foreign hubs DFW is a functional airport by American standards. Amenities are on par with other large US hubs but security checks rarely take more than 15 mins of queuing. Customs/Immigration is probably the fastest I have experienced in the US and although int'l transfer passengers must exit the secure area and undergo an additional security check this is not really different from any other US airport. Gate-to-gate transfers can be quite a trek given the size of the airport but are quite simple if your gate is closer to a Skytrain entrance. The biggest gripe is the fact that the baggage system is slow and outdated. Unless you are flying into the newer terminal D expect to wait about 30 minutes before you will see your bag.
Of many airports I have slept in overnight due to cancelled flights or early morning flight DFW is the only one I know that passes out cots to passengers who are sleeping at the airport! They pass out blankets and cots. Around 1000pm various airport staff roam the airport with their electric carts passing out these cots and blankets to anyone who wants one. At Narita airport in Japan they actually gather passengers to a secured area of the airport check their papers and then turn off the lights. Although Narita airport doesn't pass out blankets and cots the area where they cordon off passengers have seats that you can stretch out on.
DFW is a very nice airport with great maintenance and cleanliness. The newer International D- Terminal is very nice and modern. Also the Skytrain is very convenient and useful.
Little short of a shambles recently. Took over 90 minutes to get a BA 747 through immigration which meant that getting a connecting flight was touch and go. What made it a lot worse was that connecting passengers do not stay in a secure area but have to go through security again. On top of this the air con was so poor that the terminals were unpleasantly warm.
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport is very large and clean airport. Its overall aesthetic appeal puts it in contrast to say Chicago O'Hare International. Plan sufficient time for connections! This airport is on the list of the world's busiest the airport complex is massive and the last problem you want to have when travelling is to miss a flight. There is however a tram system that is helpful.
"A pleasant change from LAX and San Diego my home airports. Arrived in transit and had to spend two hours here. As I was looking at a large directory sign I was approached by a very nice lady who wore a tag identifying her as an ""ambassador"" of the airport. She handed me a small map and directory and explained the skylink a free train system the airport has to take you from one terminal to another. It is clearly marked and had signs specifying what terminal the train took you to. The airport was clean had plenty of shops and restaurants and was well organized. I didn't have to pick up baggage or go through customs but the airport itself is one of the better ones I've been in."
DFW airport is decent in terms of check in security access etc but one has to pay to just even drop someone. The cart costs $3 while it is free in 3rd world countries like India. So is the wifi which is free at most Indian airports but not available for free at DFW airport. There is not much to eat for people who drop off passengers except at Terminal D. Not many international flights there as well.
Transportation around the airport was terrible. For that reason alone I prefer to avoid Dallas FW but will go through it if the only other option is LAX. Other than transport it's a pretty average airport for the US. Security and Customs are subpar but not unbearable. The level of service is generally substandard as well.
Last October 2008 we came through Immigration in transit for LHR from Mexico as we were British (foreigners) our queue was huge it took 3 hours to get through! We were lucky we did not miss our next flight but a whole lot of people did! Nightmare - they need more officers for the foreigners - Americans fly through in a breeze I must add. However as an Airport fantastic - just got to help people through Immigration - it is only because of a lack of staff!
US Immigration and Customs are efficient and normally quite friendly. Airport security is thorough but friendly and efficient as well. Terminal transfers via the overhead train system inside security is wonderfully easy. I have gotten stuck at DFW for hours at a time because of cancelled flights on several occasions and there is no better place to be. In Terminal D there are ample restaurants both fast food and real food which are quick and good. There is lots of shopping and things to do while making time. No free wireless internet though just paid via T-Mobile. Other terminals also have decent restaurants and shopping but you can always take the train to terminal D if time permits. Baggage claim and ground transportation are a breeze as is parking if you have to drive there to pick somebody up. Check in is just as easy and convenient because of the terminal layout.
Went through DFW in and out on our travel from LHR to SJO and were very impressed by the speed and politeness of immigration the efficiency of the security staff and terminal D itself. It did not take more than 25 minutes from immigration luggage reclaim luggage check-in for our next flight and security to the departure lounge. Terminal D is very clean with plenty of seats shops and restaurants. Wifi was not working everywhere though. experience.
I connected in DFW on my way from FLL to SNA on AA. The AA terminal felt like a very upscale mall. Floor to ceiling windows with plenty of natural light. Beautiful polished marble floors. Modern super-functional layout with excellent signage. Real plants (at least they looked like it) hanging out of the second floor. Many quality shopping and eating venues
Had been to DFW (from GRU on AA) twice in the past 12 months - and I consider it my best airport experience in the Americas. On both oCcasions I took no longer than 20 min from the moment the plane touched the gate until I passed through customs on terminal D. Immigration queues processed very quickly as well. The last time I had less than 40 min for a connecting flight on terminal C and thanks to the very efficient inter-terminal tranportation (Skylink with trains arriving every 2 minutes) I safely made it. The new terminal D is modern and has many alternatives for eating and shopping inside security.
Flew in and out of DFW. Immigration queues a nightmare one member of security staff was rude and unhelpful not a nice welcome to the USA for anyone.By time we cleared these two hurdles we had five minutes to board our ongoing flight and had to run like mad to get to the departure gate in another terminal. Airport train system was good efficient and very rapid. The airport is quite comfortable very spacious and a good variety of restaurants. We had a five hour layover on our return and eventually waited at our gate only to find they had changed the gate without informing anyone!
DFW is a great place to wait out an airport delay as often happens. There are good restaurants there good shopping huge terminals to get a little walking exercise and those great massage chairs that I never pass up using. I use this airport very frequently and love it. It's a bit far out of Dallas and the traffic is abominable out there but the airport itself can hardly be faulted.
"I've connected through DFW on 12 separate flights and have never had a problem getting from terminal to terminal. Yes it would be great if I arrived at Gate A5 and departed at Gate A6 every time (this actually happened to me once!) but that's not a reasonable expectation at any airport. The SkyTrain takes me where I need to go in an acceptable amount of time and with a minimal amount of fuss. I like the simple and logical layout of DFW with gates on the outside and shops restrooms and restaurants on the inside of each semicircle-shaped terminal. To those who say that ""DFW has the worst layout of any airport"" I would add ""...except for all the other airports at which I've connected"". Now if they would only make a place for smokers inside security."
"Flew in to the new international terminal and was impressed with its size and facilities - well it is Texas. The decor was a bit bland but that's not the purpose of the facility. The real kicker was in the security clearance for the domestic leg. There was a mother with two small children--an infant in meltdown mode and a two year old who was doing his best after flying overnight. The gatekeeper was a sour looking woman who seemed most delighted by having the authority to say ""no"". The mom in all the confusion had not removed her shoes and was sent back to rectify this open challenge to the rules. She went through with the baby and Little Miss Sunshine noted that the boy had both shoes and a sweater on! Her response was two-fold first she prohibited mom from going back to help and responded to the child by telling him that mommy was going to leave him unless he played by the rules. There was not a person in line who was not ready to tackle her and beat her senseless but that is not the best approach these days. Finally a decidely non Latino TSA male came over squatted down and spoke at length to the child in Spanish. Big credits for his help. But overall it was ""security"" at its most absurd. Transfer to Terminal A on SkyLink was fine after that and the rest of the time there was ordinary airport time."
Because of the way DFW is set and because the airport is so sprawling it is an absolute necessity know the arrival gate when picking someone up. Without that you are lost. We are new to Dallas and it is almost impossible to get an accurate gate designation. I must leave in 30 minutes to pick up my party - and their flight arrival info isn't yet posted on the airport website. In light of the way the airport is set up DFW must do a better job of informing patrons of arrival gates - and not 10 minutes before the flight lands! It sucks right now.
Flew through DFW last week and due to inclement weather I had to spend the night at the airport. If you're in this situation look for the kids play areas in the middle of Terminals B and C. They have long couches that you can really stretch out on
I've connected at DFW on AA twice in the past week and I must admit that my opinions about DFW have improved. It appears that AA now has enough elbow room with operations in terminals A B C and D... so the terminals themselves are not the jam-packed cattle pens they used to be. Skylink is an improvement over the older Airtrans people-mover system. Interior signage and aesthetics are okay not great. I noticed that many of the digital clocks have been removed so one can't tell with a glance while walking down the concourse what time it is... but that's a minor point.
This is my hometown airport. It's great to fly out of and fine to fly back into as a final destination. But I cannot imagine have to change planes here even with the Skylink. Real hassle. On the upside the new terminal D is very very cool and the staff is extremely nice and helpful. (They have volunteers in cowboy hats to welcome you and offer help and directions.) The restaurants and shops are reasonably priced and good quality.
"Never thought I'd write these words but I had a very agreeable TSA experience when transiting DFW the other week. Having along with a herd of fellow PAX deposited my hand baggage items + shoes on the conveyor for scanning I then filed through the x-ray brandishing my boarding pass and photo ID. The man checking these engaged in pleasant chat with everyone who passed through - ""How are you doing Sir/Madam?"" and commented on our destinations - ""Tampa Florida Sir? Nice place..."" OK so it was a bit of an charade but I welcomed the injection of a bit of humanity to took the sting out of a normally stressful experience. So has the DFW example of the TSA human touch been rolled out nationally? Anything but it seems - thus at TPA just two of us in line boarding passes and photo IDs in hand - but this did not stop a martinet TSA person from bellowing at us harshly to have these items ready (with an absence of Please! too) - she did not even bother to check that we were ready for her which makes one wonder about the actual vigilance of TSA employees. Likewise long security lines at STL encouraged a TSA guy to bellow at (and irritate) all and sundry."
Connected in DFW enroute SEA-DCA. Clean comfortable and with great amenities. Choices for eating were good. Found the concourse to be light-filled with good views of the airside. Transit time was brief but I would not hesitate to go through DFW again.
With the new Terminal D DFW has become much much better. Customs & Immigration are the quickest most efficient that I have seen at any US airport. International baggage claim is fast as well. If you are connecting to another flight however it can be a bit confusing. When visited there were several different baggage recheck stations depending on destination and there was not much direction available. Signage for inter-terminal connections in the International arrivals area is also in need of improvement. AA's domestic terminals (A and C primarily) continue to be renovated and are improving. Terminal D departures area is easily the nicest in the whole airport if not the state.
I live in the Dallas area and use DFW frequently. If DFW is your starting or end point it's not a bad airport really. Parking is plentiful and if you live in the area it's especially nice that you can use your TollTag to pay for parking and avoid the lines! Security rarely takes more than 10 minutes to get through
I fail to see why everyone is commenting on the bad plans of the layout at DFW. I wonder if they have ever visited other airports like Atlanta Hartsfield. DFW is brilliant in the fact that they have security entrances at every terminal along with a baggage claim for each terminal. Layovers aren't bad either. If you can read you can navigate through DFW. As for the individual who associated DFW as bad because American Airlines was there and they change gates all the time I challenge you to find me an airport where gate changes don't happen.
The problems connecting at DFW are gone with the addition of Skylink. There are 2 stations at the N & S ends of each terminals (all inside security). The new international terminal is the premiere international terminal. The maximum ride time is 10 min (furthest distance) and the wait for a train is around 2 min. Most passengers can get to another terminal if needed in a maximum time of around 15 min. Most airlines allow at least an hour to connect. Anyone with common sense would read the signs and ride Skylink to their next terminal if needed. With the addition of Skylink you will not find a better airport to begin end or connect to your final destination. DFW is far better than ATL (talk about long walks and the old underground train doesnt offer the view skylink does of Dallas & Fort Worth. DFW has positioned itself for the spike in air travel before all other major airports. Look for it to be well positioned for future passenger growth.
Flying by Air Canada Jazz we used the brand new Term D that just opened the week before. I have to admit that i think that was one of the shortest walks I've taken from the gate to get to my luggage. It took about 3 mins tops to get from the gate. I didn't have to wait too long for the luggage to arrive - it took about 10-15 mins. But I guess not alot of others would get this since only flights from Canada don't have to go through customs at Term D. Upon leaving things went by pretty smooth. The check-in area is massive and the ACJ counter is at the very end. Going through security was a breeze. The only knock i had against DFW is alot of shops weren't open at the time - they should have waited at least another week before opening Term D since alot of the shops and stores weren't open yet. I'm sure by now Term D is up and running at 100%. It didn't turn out as bad as everyone said it would be.
"I do like the fact that the luggage carousel is just a step away from your gate and that helps things if DFW is your final destination. I wish other airports would do that. Think of the time it would save! I also like that the check in at the curb is no more than a minute or two from your gate. However if DFW is your connecting airport that is another story! The 'airtrain"" has to be the slowest way to get to your next gate which of course is on the other side of the airport. The train is fine if you have an hour or so between flights but for some reason you are delayed it is agonizing to be on the train hoping you can make your flight. So if I were giving stars DFW would get four out of ten. Good restaurants shopping etc bathrooms not very clean."
I live in Austin and I have to go through DFW more often than not. Everything they say about DFW is true and I think I know the reason: DFW was designed to be an endpoint not a hub. The horseshoe- shaped terminals are great for jumping out of the jetway go across the aisle get your luggage and get out of the terminal. I don't believe the designers thought the best way to go from point A to B is through a semi-circle. The problem is that DFW would be dead as an endpoint. Let's face it the Dallas/Fort Worth area doesn't receive that many visitors. DFW has grown so much in an attempt to make it more hub-like which is costing a lot of money: three trains (well - two now) none of which actually solves the problem sings all over the place advising you when to walk and when to take the train annoying golf carts asking you to get out of the way and all sorts of gimmicks to make the place more efficient. If out of a sudden AA went bust DFW would be a hot potato in the hands of the two city governments. So now DFW's survival depends on AA remaining aloft or some other airline taking it as a hub if AA went away. The problem is the first thing an airline operations manager will see is that DFW's design is not the best for a hub SkyLink and all.
This airport is not as bad as people are saying. The only negative thing I can comment on is the long walk from terminal to terminal. However after 6 hours flight it was a pleasure to be able to stretch our legs and walk around a bit before our next flight. The check-out counter wasn't as bad bearing in mind we had our kids between us. Even my little on wanted to use the toilet as soon as we got to the immigration counter. It wasn't our turn but the staff asked the rest of the family to stay while I took my daughter to the toilets and back. We did have to collect our bags (route was to Orlando) and recheck them so they could be taken to Orlando. As soon as we left immigration there were airport staff waiting for us asking for bags to Orlando. The other negative is that you always have to check the boards to check which terminal you will be connecting. The announcement on our plane from London gave a different terminal when we were coming out but on getting inside airport the boards gave a completely different one. However I think it is a good airport. Yes the security checks is madness but this is the world we live in. I would rather go through this sort of security checks than be killed by some terrorist. In my opinion it is not a bad airport for its size. The airport is clean the toilet facilities were excellent the cafes restaurants and shops were good maybe a bit expensive but this is what you get at most airports.
Living in Dallas there is no comparison between Love field and DFW. Love field is much quicker and efficient. It may not be as glossy but the chances of getting out on time are much much better. Also I have had flights cancelled at DFW that were never posted on the board. A couple times I waited a couple hours then was told at the gate when I went to check in that the flight was cancelled.
Great little airport. So convenient to the heart of Dallas you are in and out in a flash. Nothing like the behemoth that is DFW. DFW has nice facilities which Dallas Love does not have but you won't be hanging out there long enough to need them chances are. They do have decent places to eat so you are covered there just don't expect to go on some shopping spree.
This airport is great for a quick get in and get out as the gates are relatively close together on the Southwest side of the airport. Not much in the way of shops and restaurants but this airport isn't really designed for that kind of traffic. It's probably going to have to go through some changes and cleaning as they start adding more flights.
"I flew into Love Field recently and it is very much ""A Tale of Two Airports."" The Main Concourse where Southwest Operates has adequete food and shopping but it looks and smells like a Greyhound Terminal circa 1970. Security lines are long and slow much worse than DFW. The 3 new AA Gates in the old Braniff East Concourse are great - very clean and comfortable but quite a long walk from the Main Hall. AA built the new area in 2001 when it was competing with Legend's long-haul premium service from Love but never opened it when they pulled out of Love after 9/11. Easing the Wright Amendment forced AA back in to compete with Southwest on 4 high-volume routes. If you have cause to fly to/from Austin Kansas City St Louis or San Antonio out of Love use AA's gates."
A regional airport used predominantly for low-fare high-frequency service in the South Central United States. It is much smaller and much closer to downtown than DFW. The central terminal is old and not seen much in the way of updates. The security was fairly efficient on a Sunday but I can see where it would be problematic during the week. The concourses desperately need work. Southwest is the predominant carrier here and its concourse is congested stuffy and drab. Lounge areas are worn and the TVs barely work. Continental uses two gates close to the central terminal that ought to be condemned. American just recently opened three gates at the far end of the east concourse and when I say far I mean far. By the time I got to the last American gate I was almost too tired to walk back to the terminal. They spent a lot of money to make a clean and comfortable gate complex and it was completely empty.
The airport's renovation seemed to come in handy no looking much more sophisticated. On the way to the airport I couldn't but help notice the new terminal that is in construction. Duty free is excellent with well anticipated manners displayed by staff. The airport itself handles more than Beirut international airport although it is much smaller in size. Restaurants sell reasonable food at magnificent prices. New bars have opened throughout the airport as well as ATMs and other necessities.
I first arrived in Damascus in Feb 1997. Since then I have been back and forth almost 1-2 times a year since then. I am an Englishman who met and married a Syrian girl in 1998. The airport in my view was more relaxed in the old days whereby you could check in and walk back into the lounge/cafe for tea etc with your friends and family.
Our late night arrival was surprisingly easy to manage. After a coached journey to the terminal (some planes use jetties) it was straight into the immigration hall (currency exchange immediately on the right) which had a couple of lanes for “non Arab passports”. The lines moved quite quickly and we were soon into the baggage hall where our bags were waiting. Customs took no interest and one is soon landside where there is an ATM (one of a small working number in Syria) a Currency Exchange and minor shops. We were met on arrival so I cannot comment on ground transport arrangements but there did seem to be numerous “taxi drivers” seeking fares. There are many worse airports throughout the world most of which are major airports.
It is not the most beautiful airport in the world but not the worst! I always found it OK - speed to check-in pass passport control is OK. Shopping cheap and wide range of products - VIP Lounge comfortable but old fashioned. The information system is getting better and friendliness of officials is good.
The refurbishment is finished. Everything looked clean and new. Fast check-in. Information screens were giving correct and up-to-date information. Good catering facilities to have a drink coffee or sandwich. Cheap duty free shops which are not the biggest but still have a good assortment of quality products spirits sweets perfumes etc.
Damascus airport must be one of the worst airports in the world. We were checking into a Saudi a flight and no information was provided on the overhead screens as to which gate was to be used for checking in. In this end one had to push trollys to all the gates to guess where the Saudia passengers were being checked in. At each counter there was a guy loading baggage on the belt and it was expected that we hand him some money. The regulation of smoking in the airport was appalling the whole airport stank of cigarettes including the toilets. The airport was undergoing refurbishment but the experience was chaotic.
The airport is under refurbishment and concrete dust coats everything. Still the only working departure display is in the duty free on the upper floor. The zone between entrance and gates is declared non smoking area with one bathroom size glass cage for hundreds of potential smokers. Consequently the final pre-takeoff-smoke is shifted to the gate waiting room where all passengers including babies and allergics spent half an hour in an air which one could cut out with a knife and use as durable construction material.
Damascus Airport gives an unfairly poor impression of Syria. The arrivals area was basic but immigration was conducted quite quickly if without charm. Departure was simply chaotic. As another reviewer pointed out the check in desks have no signage. We found our desk by a process of elimination by wandering up to each desk in turn checking the small paper sign and concluding that ours must be another one. The queue moved painfully slowly with each check in taking 5 minutes. When we reached the top of the queue we realised why - it appeared that every piece of information on out e-ticket had to be keyed in to the computer. The duty free seemed to house the only departure monitor in the whole airport. Worryingly our flight did not appear. We then noticed that the flight number and time on the boarding passes were different to those on our tickets - I guess due to typing errors. Our flight departed at the time on the ticket if we had believed he boarding pass we would have missed it ! While we passed though several security checks no-one seemed to be checking the magnetic gates and at the departure gate I noticed that a door onto the apron was unlocked and unguarded. I guess the authorities figure they have other ways of preventing terrorist attacks. The departure tax is a swingeing SYP1500 though what happens to this money is not evident - certainly not on the airport facilities. Just treat the airport as an experience and don't let it put you off visiting Syria.
Note that the airport departure tax is SP1500 for over 12s. All taxis from airport are run by private company and are fixed rate. The cost is around $35. All previous comments re chaos at departure. excessive zeal by document checking officials overcrowding etc are still as relevant as ever. A thoroughly depressing experience in what is a friendly generous and wonderful country.
Expect to be ripped off by the taxi drivers taking you into and out of the city. Don't go with any of the people hassling you as soon as they see you come out of the airport for an airport taxi. They would charge you a mind-blowing 15euros to the city. The immigration process was fairly OK even if slow but they could do with some signposting in English. Back from the airport I was ripped off 1000 SYPs by a yellow cab. The check in process is appalling - I don't know for what does one pay 200 syp departure tax. The check in desks are in a severe need for refurbishment. My checkin desk was not even shown on the noticeboard and then a fellow passenger showed me to my checkin desk - indeed it had a handwritten sign stuck with sticky tape to the roof saying 'LONDON'! The duty free section is quite large and varied and one could make a few decently priced purchases from here. One looks forward to visiting the airport when the refurbishment currently being undertaken by a Malaysian company is completed.
Yes the check-in process is slow. I have never seen anyone read documents as thoroughly as the Syrians do. There are several stages of scrutiny that one must pass before gaining entry to the pax area. But Syrians are friendly and generous people. Duty free is dirt cheap and in Syria it is available to domestic flights. Damascus features some of the best people watching that I have experienced anywhere. There are very few flights going to Europe and virtually none going to North America. Most flights are going to the Middle East or Africa. The array of gowns headgear and you-name-it clothing was charming and fascinating.
Damascus airport has two faces. The arrivals hall and the baggage reclaim hall really need some work as it looks as though they are falling apart. The baggage carousels in particular are too worn. However baggage reclaim was fast. The departures area is slightly different from other airports in that only the passenger can go to the area with the check-in desks. Check-in can be very slow even with short lines of people. Thankfully they don't seem to be too bothered about overweight luggage. Everyone needs to pay a departure tax before passport control - don't forget this! Then before you get to your gate you can access some shops selling newspapers tobacco and coffee.
I was happy with the acceptable duty free with good prices arrival at immigration is terrible with long queues and people cutting through the lines with ease - expect a minimum of 40 minutes to pass the immigration desks specially at peak hours. The security check at the departure hall is chaotic and it may be wise to use your shoulders to shrug your way through. Check in counters are acceptable depending on your airline.
Ride from city to airport should not cost more than 200 Syrian pounds in a metered taxi. Airport was quiet at that moment which could not prevent the chaos at the first security checkpoint. Passport checked four times (including immigration and check-in). Although I had an e-ticket with LH and OS it turned out that DAM is not an e-ticket station and could not accept this. Airline staff at check-in phoned the Austrian office downtown trying to solve the problem but they couldn't change it either which meant that I had to buy a new ticket for the DAM-VIE leg. VIE-AMS could be continued on the e-ticket again although not without more hassle at VIE itself. Airline-staff courteous and friendly. Executive Lounge is roomy with good food and several liquors (it's still an islamic country). Prices in the duty-free shops looked okay. Don't know about the toilets which have been mentioned in previous comments.
"Damascus Airport was quite an experience! The duty free as others have said IS amazingly cheap and very well stocked. When I got to Immigration the fun began. The visa was fine but the officials I met had never seen a New Zealand Passport before! After a few phone calls to HQ in town they let me in with a lot of apologies. They were very friendly though. Once through there is an ATM to withdraw cash a currency conversion booth or two and a counter where you pay 600 syrian pounds for a taxi voucher then they see you into the taxi. Going out even more of an experience! 75 syrian pounds to get a baggage trolley and get in then someone takes off with the trolley 'to whisk you through further"" then it's baksheesh for another hundred pounds... not a lot of money just annoying. Passport check at front of check in hall. Check in were very friendly another passport check. Then you pay two hundred pounds departure tax then go for the third passport check... this is the proper passport check departure Syria. The toilets are holes in the ground and they stink. The only thing that really bugged me was being locked in a glass cage with a hundred or so other people for an hour and a half while we waited for the aeroplane to arrive. If there had been toilets and water available after passport control it would not have been too bad -thank goodness I happened to have some water and juice with me just in case!!"
I know that summer is the busiest time for air traffic in the Middle East. I was expecting to go through hell during my connection at Damascus International Airport. I was completely wrong. When i arrived from London the airport was experiencing its maximum traffic. My connection time was 5 hours. I was amazingly surprised by the low prices at the fantastic duty free. It was one of the nicest i have ever seen. I got a great deal on an EOS camera
During peak time the check-in area is near impossible to navigate. Most passengers just push their way to the front of queues so if you want to be served you also have to push and be ruthless. Airside the airport is clean and the duty-free is excellent (very cheap) though apart from shop there is nothing else to do - though you spend so much time queuing in immigration and for x-rays and check-in and to buy airport tax etc etc etc that there's never much time left.
Damascus airport is small but clean. The toilets on first floor have no water so rush to ground floor is heavy particularly when 747 SP brings a full load of passengers. If joining from Damascus come well in time. Only two X-Rays machine were working and there was made rush due to ID holidays. Do not forget to purchase SP 200 airport departure tax stamp otherwise you shall have to return from Immigration. The counter staff and Immigration personnel are very co-operative.
Clean and tidy lots of seats good number of passport control desks resulting in no delays. A very high standard duty free with cheap quality goods. Got a Seiko watch for about £90 and found out when I got back to the UK that it costs £350 on the high street!
I was a transit passenger through Damascus airport twice. On the face of it it appears clean and tidy but as you spend more time there it's seriously lacking. Firstly there's no where to change money or obtain visa advances. I arrived with £1000GBP of travellers cheques and had a 4 hour connection. I was unable to purchase any food or drink and the 1 restaurant that is there only accepts Syrian money. If you are lucky you can pay with euro pounds or dollars in hard cash. Otherwise you have to starve or die of first. There is a duty free shop that accepts visa and sells incredibly cheap cigarettes (I think they were $1USD a packet). However you won't be able to buy any food or drink to consume with your visa card unless you don't mind living off toblerone and whisky. Toilets didn't have any toilet paper in them. I was sitting on the seats and I left my girlfriend. When I returned she had moved because an older Syrian (I presume?) guy had started waving his stick at her and telling her to move. He had then requisitioned the whole seat and sat around 9 burkah wearing women on the seat opposite him. Transfer desk and being booked onto the next flight was efficient apart from competing with Indians for a Delhi transfer was like taking part in a scrum. The airport seriously needs a money changer and VISA ATM in the departure lounge.
I think Damascus International Airport is much better than it used to be. The duty Free is among the best i have seen it is clean and ckeck in is really quick. The new business lounge is nice. IThe ggod thing is that there is never crowding problems because of quick passport control and numerous check in desks.
The place is awful to both fly into and depart from. Unorganised chaos poor facilities rude immigration staff. Just avoid it at all costs. I've flown into hundreds of airports all over the world and this place is the worst. I would strongly advise flying out of Bahrain.
This airport is probably the worst airport I have visited so far. The seating area seats were very dirty the carpets were completely littered with chip wrappers. I didn't see any cleaners or airport staff cleaning the area. The bathrooms are very in poor state no hygiene whatsoever. The service was poor and unacceptable.
Dirty old fashioned no helpful staff almost no facilities even to get a decent coffee while waiting to board. Wifi has not worked in over a year.
This airport is so below standard as to make it worthy of being a bad third world airport. Sure the building is to a good standard but what is the point when the facilities are rubbish. Immigration: 4 hours or more standing there are few seats and with the staff telling you to stand. I have visited too many airports where you would expect poor service due to it being a poor country many have made you far more welcome queues at least move people try and get you through. Words are not enough to state the lack of quality of this airport.
No flight information no staff who can communicate in English to clear customs for international flights will take a very long time. The lounges are below standard airports are old taxis outside do not use meters and therefore the drivers set the price. I have flown and travelled all over the world but when comparing Saudi airports in general to other international airports Saudi airports lack quality in just about every department very disappointing indeed.
Recently flew in and out of Riyadh airport and commented on how appalling the whole airport experience was. Complete chaos on entering the airport queues completely ignored people pushing to the front with officials ignoring the fact passport control inefficient beyond words total lack of customer care or basic respect for other human beings. Leaving queues of people standing for up to 6 hours waiting for a totally disinterested official to grunt and gesture at you before begrudgingly stamping your passport allowing entry or exit. This time I thought Dammam would be a viable alternative to the Riyadh experience there cannot possibly be 2 airports in the same country that are so appallingly below any reasonable standard can there? Yes there can Dammam was actually a slightly worse experience than Riyadh! The passport control people are clones of their Riyadh counterparts total disinterest in anything other than their tea breaks socialising with their colleagues staring at their mobile phones and generally sitting around doing nothing for long periods before waving the next unfortunate traveller up to the desk. Please fill out an exit card before queuing I was told there were no cards available when I started and told to join the queue anyway. By the time I got to the front cards had actually appeared some way back in the passport control area (no one was told this). So I was then turned away and sent to the back of the queue again told to fill out an exit card. There must have been 20-30 people straight after me who had this experience. Basic levels of customer care are totally devoid here. In contrast I landed at Heathrow disembarked passport control and picked up my case in 35mins - a shining example of what an airport can do when run by intelligent efficient caring people - these places are two polar opposites!
We have flown in and out of this local airport regularly for the past nine years. while the facility is large/oversized the service is far below acceptable international standards. Immigration and passport control on entering the country is slow and can take over 2-3 hours depending upon your arrival time since this airport is the first entry point for many Asian low wage workers. If you are in line behind a 747 full of new workers you will be stuck for a very long time so presume the worst. The recent new rule requiring finger prints for all departing passengers will now make exit worse mandatory check in is now 4 hours before departure
I arrived in Turkish airways from Istanbul to Dammam. When I reached the immigration I found more than 200 people standing in the available 4 counters for the first time/visit visa of which there was just one counter with a personnel. It was a total mess with few people coming to the counter for a few minutes and then serving a few people and then going for a break. My flight landed at 01.00 am and I was only able to clear the immigration at 07.00 am. When I tried to tell the person in counter about the 6 hour wait he pointed at some other passengers and stated that they reached at 10 pm. I found it total negligence and I would not recommend any first time visitor to select this airport.
This is by far the worst airport I've flown into. I flew First Class from London to Dammam via Doha. The immigration procedure is mind numbing. It took more than 2 hours to clear immigration having arrived along with flights from Kenya Bangladesh and Dubai. Immigration officials were busy chatting with each other and having constant coffee breaks. On my return flight departures took almost an hour - again seeing immigration officials taking coffee breaks instead of doing their jobs! I almost missed my flight.
I arrived at this airport from Dubai at about 10pm and it took 2.5 half hours to get through immigration. Staff were slow unwilling to do anything to sort the queue and generally obnoxious.
Poor airport to be honest and I've used it a number of times. The last time I flew I got my boarding passes and went to go through passport control only to be told the flight was delayed until the next day. I was turned away with many others I suspect people may have even left the airport. Eventually I was told it was on time I then joined a lengthy passport control queue. I waited around 45 mins and got within 5 people of the front to discover the person running the queue had left without warning. He returned 20 mins later staff seemed unfriendly making the whole thing even worse.
I've traveled via this airport many times for international flights using different airlines - recently service has improved in terms of shops available as well as airlines serving this destination. I would recommend using Dammam airport for travelling to the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia as the roads has also improved after constructing new tunnels and bridges it wouldn't take more than 45 minutes to reach the airport from any nearby city including Khobar and Jubail.
"Dammam airport is huge with about 65 gates but in reality it doesn't need to be. Arrival was painless. Immigration looks as if it will take forever at first but as soon as immigration staff realise it's going to be busy they open more desks and the queue soon clears. Customs scan every bag from every person as you leave. When returning you must have your checked luggage scanned before check in otherwise you cannot check the bag. Queues for check in weren't too bad but then I was 3 hours early for the KLM flight. Be prepared before going through security as although the queue looks long it moves fast and security staff get annoyed if they have to ask you to remove your belt watch etc but they are very pleasant if you are ready. The flight I was waiting for was leaving at 1:15am and there were a few international flights but the cafe was closed. The only place to buy refreshments was from a ""trolley"" however the coffee wasn't bad and wasn't too expensive but nothing to eat that was hot. There is one duty free shop with various items for sale (including washing powder?) and prices are okay. I walked from one end of the airport to the other which took 10 minutes at normal pace and only 6 gates had passengers waiting by them. Interestingly there used to be a few Business Class lounges but these appear to have been closed and moved to one lounge such is the under use of this airport. I would be happy to fly though this airport again mainly because even though there is nothing really to do it is easy to find somewhere quiet to relax and plenty of seats and the staff are mostly very friendly."
Not much to add to the comments below. Immigration tends to be slow. Security very thorough requiring removal of belts with metal buckles and shoes. Needless passport and boarding card inspections between departure lounge and aircraft.
Dammam Airport is a fairly new construction situated in the desert about 60 kilometres from the Dammam/Dahran/Al Khobar metropolitan area and a similar distance from the petro-chemical industrial city of Jubail. It is large pretty well organised and clean. It seems to be operating well under capacity. Due to its distance from town reaching the airport by road can take up to an hour and a half depending where you start from and a taxi fare which is the only way to get there is going to be high - around US$50+. Despite its size facilities for passangers waiting for flights are pretty limited with a couple of unispiring cafes and gift shops. A long wait there can be very boring and it makes sense to obtain a bording pass in advance for Saudia flights from their offices in town to reduce the amount of time spent at the airport. Of course if your flight is delayed you have no choice but to sit tight and wait. For very long delays as there is no hotel at the airport the long trip back to Dammam to find a bed is a would be required. If you are flying Saudia don't expect them to help much. An alternative worth considering if you are traveling to or from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is to fly through Bahrain as the airport there is about the same distance from the centre of Dammam as Dammam airport is. Crossing the causeway is pretty straight forward outside of the Saudi weekend when it becomes busy to Bahrain on Thursday afternoon/evening and Back to Saudi on Friday evening. Bahrain airport much more customer friendly but taxi fare will be more approx US100.
"I have to say my second arrival in Dar was much better than the first. First time arrived amid a plague of flying cockroach-like insects that were all attracted to the light inside the terminal. Spent ages swatting them in a huge line for immigration that took over an hour only to then be told I needed a ""special"" permit and had to pay 200 USD (I already had a business visa). Not wanting to argue I joined the next disorganised line paid my 200 USD and waited another 30 minutes to get my passport back. Notable that everyone in the ""special"" line was Caucasian. Second time all desks open for immigration friendly hello from the official and a quick stamp and on my way. No ""special"" permit needed this time for some reason. Bags came out quickly and was out of the airport within 10 minutes of landing. Let's hope that the new terminal will be finished on time and that there will be no more ""special"" line."
I came in on a KQ (Kenya Air) flight from Ghana and immigration was a breeze. Immigration officials were pleasant and fast. I didn't have check in bags but as I waited for my colleague who did need a visa I could see that the bags arrival was quite orderly. Outside had the usual cab drivers trying to make a living by offering you a ride - is that such a big deal? I will add another review after I leave today - but we were able to check in online nicely!
This is the worst airport I've been to. Very unpleasant staff. They don't understand French in customs so they couldn't figure out my passport's expiration date. Very chaotic and disorganised especially during check-in.
Chaotic check in very slow immigration. Sub standard business lounge. Allow a lot more time to get through the process than you would take at a normal airport.
Very poor airport. Very long waiting time to come into terminal building. Hot temperature outside and even inside. Not very clean airport. Staff very inexperienced.
Terminal feels like it was built in the 1960s and is stuck in a time warp. Very small and a bit cramped with some (expensive) shops airside and some cafeterias. Dimly lit inside and air conditioning is not optimal so on hot days it can get quite uncomfortable. Waiting area is alright but not comfortable. No WiFi in the airport
The service quality from security guards and the staff is probably the worst you can possibly get. The waiting area is uncomfortable not enough seating with awful toilets. All in all a lousy airport.
Another horrible airport. We arrived on a South African Airways flight from Johannesburg in the afternoon. We were funnelled into immigration and customs area which has no air conditioning in this hot and humid city. Foreigners gathered around the glass booths where officials came out took your passport and visa payment then disappeared inside. The process took about an hour meanwhile our luggage had been taken off the conveyer belt and put aside unguarded in a hallway. When you exit the terminal you are hounded by taxi drivers asking outrageous prices. When we arrived to fly out our Precision Air flight had broken down in Zanzibar and was delayed. However they gave few details on when it was expected to resume. It was a very uncaring attitude by the check-in staff. We were delayed 3 hours and were caught off guard by the sudden (and muffled) announcement that it was now boarding. The departure lounge has some stores but they are limited. The airport is small with few facilities.
'Simplicity' is the word to describe Dar es Salaam International Airport. The terminal itself is very basic and rudimentary. But it does have most facilities that an international airport needs. There are 'duty free shops' that sell souvenirs T-shirts electric's and cosmetics. There are restaurants that sell 'western' cuisine and soft drinks but they are overpriced. Toilets were ok not clean but not too unhygienic. Ground service was rather slow but immigration process was swift both in and out. But the airport is a bit disorganized. No A/C before the security but there is after. Don't expect wi-fi service.
I travelled to Dar for the weekend in April and found the airport much smaller that I expected. Nevertheless it is fairly clean and design allows for natural airflows - important in Dar. Arrival relatively painless although the baggage conveyor belt doesn't work so instead there are airport officials asking which flight you were in and directing you to the bags. Departure was a different thing altogether. I needed to purchase a ticket but lo and behold there wasn't a single ticketing office (airline offices and agents included) that accepted any kind of cards whatsoever. So the trick is to withdraw cash at ATM. There are three ATMs and everyone at the airport was quite sure they don't work. I approached all 3 to confirm for myself but was waved away by staff and security as well as shop attendants who were quite sure they do not work. Mercifully a taxi man offered to take me to the nearest one that may be working outside the airport for free - an offer I accepted. Having bought the ticket I chose to sit at the airport - there is sitting outside the building in a kind of pavilion which is good for the heat but the seats are hard. There was no wifi so I elected to visit the only cyber cafe at the airport which had ok speeds but charged in blocks of half an hour. As I was sending emails and waiting for replies I found that method rather inconvenient. There is only one restaurant at the top with fairly good meals which I sampled whist still waiting for the flight. After checking in I proceeded to the gate I was shown waiting to board. When the boarding call was made I proceeded towards the gate but the airport staff denied be entry via that gate suggesting it was for a different flight. I was referred to other staff who referred me to the same gate and told me to wait there. We did this back and forth for a while - with me showing ticket indicating I was at the correct gate. In the end the same staff started announcing my name for final boarding call. I told them I was the one and they seemed surprised. Fortunately airline staff happened by and intervened allowing me to gain entry via the exact same gate. I raised the matter with the airline staff who didn't seem surprised at all by the escapade. I almost missed the flight over something so simple. I felt the airport staff should have been a bit more attentive and methodical in their handling of the situation.
"Needed to change airlines and reclaim and recheck luggage here en route to Nampula Mozambique. It was not at all clear which to do first. Consequently we got on the flight to Nampula on LAM but our luggage did not. Other passengers told us that this happens ""most of the time"" on this flight. The problems with baggage appear to originate in the Dar es Salaam terminal. Had it not been for some friendly and helpful staff we might not have gotten through at all."
Flew through at 22.00 with Swiss it was very quick bag drop - (check in online if you can as you can drop it of at first class desk). Airport still hot but the guys at the cafe friendly and serve drinks quick. When you have passed security at the gate they have air conditioning which is heaven after the heat of Tanzania. I like this small airport - have never had a problem and have used it several times.
This is not a good place to travel through. They stopped improving it in about 1957. There is no way you can use a credit card here to buy an airline ticket. To go and buy a ticket you have to go through security - but you need a ticket to go through security - you then have to get a pass to go through security by leaving your passport behind. Very disorganized chaotic slow lines repetitive checking for no reason hot sweaty limited service. The business class lounge is not too bad. This place really needs some work. The smaller airports in Tanzania are fine but this one has to be the worst airport for its size I have been in. The only saving grace is that most of the people are nice.
My flight was at 21.20 on a Friday night. It was very busy and if you are travelling at this time leave at least 2 hours to get to your gate. I have got through to the departure gate in 30 minutes on previous.
An airport with very basic facilities. Arrival was smooth: I waited for around 15 min for immigration clearance and 10 min for customs clearance (which was ok). In front of visa counter I saw crowds of passengers applying for visa (fortunately I did not need a visa) so if you are flying with a wide-body aircraft and you need a visa it pays to disembark as early as possible so you could proceed to visa counter quickly. The taxi stand outside arrival hall claimed to offer 'govt-regulated' fares to different parts of the city but the list could be ignored as it is pricey. Bargain with drivers. There was an exchange shop at the far end of the arrival hall which offered a relatively better exchange rate - Very similar to the rate in city so if one needs to buy some TZS that's a better option. Departure was more chaotic with the main problem being a lack of any flight information display. You just do not know which lounge is for which flight. There are a few shops in departure lounges but not impressive in particular.
There are some bars and restaurants 5 mins from the airport that are not expensive on the main road. I had to travel in rush hour it pays to get to the airport early in rush hour but you can not enter the airport before your check in time. I agree the traffic is very bad in rush hour. There is not much to keep you entertained out side the airport so there is no point getting there to early.
The airport is one challenge but the traffic volume to reach the airport is incredible. Allow lots of extra time to reach the airport from the city especially during the morning and evening rush times.
If you can book your seat at the front of the plane when you arrive it helps if you have to purchase your visa in Dar Es Salaam as it a bit of a scramble. Passport control and collecting luggage was no problem. Do not put too many clothes on when you leave as the air conditioning seems not to work - they were installing new system when I was coming through the airport.
Dar airport was probably very nice when it first opened however after decades of neglect by the airports authority it is not surprise that it is looking shabby unkempt. The airport is slow but get used to it nobody rushes in Dar. The business class lounge (soon to be rebuilt but not in a hurry!) is appalling in comparison to other airports it's got free drinks and snacks and if you are lucky you may get a seat. On the flip side of this you have the fact that if you are arriving its the gateway to one of the most beautiful and friendliest countries in the world. Look past Dar airport!
Dar must have the slowest system of processing people on arrival in the world. The queues snake up the stairs as the single kiosk attempts to deal with it all. So when you reach the bottom of the stairs you have about an hour to go. Once you get to the kiosk they take a computerised mug shot of you then you just hang around for another half an hour while that gets in the system. The whole airport needs levelling and rebuilding.
Domestic terminal is great fun. You hang about with the pilots and other passengers etc watching the flights come and go. When it's your turn you walk to the single prop climb aboard and follow the progress of the flight with your map and the GPS on the flight deck! The international terminal (built to replace the old domestic terminal) is a mess. Sweaty (aircon doesn't work) poor value shops and inefficient - a real third world job.
I have used this airport many times since 1974. In the 70s the terminal building looked like a shabby rural bus station but the building that was then erected is nice and also architecturally beautiful from inside. Decent shops. Two lounges which are small but nice and -particularly important - cool. The rest of the building is hot and humid and the a/c in the departure hall is hardly working. The toilets can also be cumbersome since water is frequently lacking.
I was suprised when going through this airport. I had purchased my visa in London before leaving. There was a small queue for non Tanzanian passport holders but a Tanzanian immigration officer said I could go through the Tanzanian passport desk. I was through in a couple of minutes. My bag was ready for collection.It was the fastest I have ever been through an airport. The only down side was the price of cigarettes in the duty free shop on leaving. They where double the price if you had bought from a supermarket in Dar Es Sallam.
For a very small airport in a poor African country its really not bad. The departure hall is relatively spacious with plenty of seats a decent cafeteria and restaurant and a good selection of souvenir shops and there's even a bc lounge (not sure if its for a certain airline). The arrival area is less nice. It is below the departure area and looks like just a concrete basement area. Neither level is fully enclosed and especially on the arrivals level which opens directly outside (no doors) there will probably be mosquitos etc. inside. There is a foreign curency exchange offering the same rates as those in the city. There isn't really any public transport (unless you count the dalla-dallas (minibuses) on the highway outside which will undoubtedly be impossible to board with any luggage) but as soon as you exit if no one meets you you're likely to have taxi drivers approaching you from all directions (don't pay more than 10000tsh (about $9).
Arrived at airport to find very little assistance and no check-in staff available despite mid afternoon time. Upstairs in departure lounges are old cracked dirty and missing pieces of vinyl. No bar facilities available again despite mid afternoon time and crowds of people in the lounge area. Very poorly sign posted. Nil star rating if that was possible!
I arrived here on a Jetstar flight from Brisbane with my 85 year old mother who needed a wheelchair. This latter was provided by Jetstar but then we were on our own to travel from the plane to the baggage area not an easy task as signage was almost non-existent and some doors along the way were locked necessitating a rather anxious wait until an official with a key card arrived. The only lift in the main area of the terminal was broken down although there was no sign about this just a loose flapping internal wall that was evident when the doors opened. This discouraged all users including us. In the end we ditched the wheelchair and proceeded slowly down the escalator. There was a total lack of information signage or assistance of any kind in this outdated dirty terminal. I intend to avoid this airport in future.
International area of terminal to catch a domestic flight to Cairns flight originated in Singapore. There were only 2 flights leaving our A321 plus a flight to Dili. Seating area was full to capacity. Male toilets completely inadequate for number of people. It was early in the morning approx 5am the coffee shop was open but the only other shop (newsagent) was closed.
"Flew in and out to and from Singapore on the way to Cairns - a bit of an uneven experience. The first time was early in the morning and most of the airport facilities were shut despite flights using the airport. Security screening into the transit lounge removed the water we had been given five minutes earlier on our Jetstar flight and there was no where to buy any more. On the way back we transited at Darwin for five hours and so went downtown by taxi ($22). Leaving the airport was easy and we were able to check our hand baggage at left luggage without trouble. Security was confusing on the way back you are first checked for everything other than ""the plastic bag"" which is then separately checked at another check point by staff some of whom have not learnt politeness. Although the airport is cramped and needs enlarging. there are far worse around. Duty Free is very expensive as are the cafes."
Used DRW this morning to fly back to SYD. At 6.30am the airport was too crowded and obviously needs to be expanded. Small selection of F&B outlets and even at that time of the morning it was way too hot and humid. It felt as if the air conditioning had not been started. All in all not very pleasant.
Darwin airport might be fine for domestic flights but is not up to scratch as an international airport. With more Tiger and Jetstar flights to Asia via Darwin this airport needs to lift its game. It took nearly an hour to get through immigration and customs on my flight from Singapore which was only 60% full. Only three immigration officers on duty - one queue for all nationalities - while two customs officers eyeing the stationary queue for drug mules. These officers then searched every second bag (welcome to Australia!) before we got into the small and uninspiring terminal where check-in queues can be horrendous.
If you want slow immigration clearances and unfriendly staff on arrival Darwin is your port of choice. Most flights arrive into Darwin in the early hours of the morning. Staff is always short. And everyone is given the third degree and queuing is not segregated. So if your an Australian behind a family of 5 overseas visitors expect to sit waiting for them while visas travel arrangements and passports are examined in every minute detail even though most residents arriving are a quick once over. I choose to fly into any other airport in Australia if returning from international destinations. The last flight I returned from overseas was a Tiger flight from Singapore. It was full and 90min late. Approximately 30% of the flight were late for a connecting Melbourne flight which was awaiting them. All these 30% were poorly directed to just 1 immigration staff while 1 experienced and 2 trainees looked after the rest of the flight. Most of the transit customers lined up in the normal queue and were returned to the back of the transit queue once they reached the front as there were only a few staff giving verbal directions to arriving customers. In addition the International arrival and departure areas are small. Its not uncommon for arriving queues to snake back through the airbridges. It looks as if the international terminal was added as an afterthought. The only thing Darwin Airport has going for it is free and ready access to smoking areas in departure lounges.
Compared to other airports its very small but pleasant with limited shops and dinning options. Very quick check-in and cleared security in record time. Had to walk out through a sheltered walkway to board the flight to Perth.
Regrettably domestic doesn't have much in the way of seating for waiting passengers whose check-in desks have not opened as access to shops and departure lounges is through security with only a small cafe on the ground floor. The airport needs to invest in some waiting area seats provide some more vending machines entertainment facilities and more ground floor shops.
I have made frequent visits to Australia both for business and pleasure over the last ten years although in April I made my first visit to Darwin. I arrived domestically on a Qantas flight from Adelaide and there were no complaints - hardly any distance to walk from the arrival gate and relatively quick baggage delivery. My international departure to Singapore however a few days later was a different story. Check-in takes place for all flights domestic and international in a very small terminal area. There were two check-in staff servicing a fairly full A330-300 aircraft and although we arrived a good 2 hours prior to departure we had to queue practically outside the terminal building and by the time we arrived at the desk we had about twenty minutes to get through immigration and security. As a result the flight had to be delayed. Qantas international departures use gate 6 I think at Darwin - three immigration officers were on duty for the whole flight which I find to be completely unacceptable. The gate area contains one duty free shop / cafe and has seating for about 80 people at best - I can imagine a huge delay here to be purgatory. The upside of the airport is that it is only 5-10 minutes from the city centre by car and would probably have to rate as one of the best landings into an airport in the world for scenery but they need to get one or two things sorted particularly the international flight departures before it can be regarded as being a great gateway to a fantastic Australian city.
The airport is rather small compared to its other Australian siblings then again it only served a handful of International Airlines (mainly Garuda Continental & Qantas). Only 5-10 minutes from the Esplanade of Darwin via Airport Shuttle Bus - it's practically built on the edge of the city. Checking-in and clearing customs are done efficiently with minimal fuss. I was in the Domestic Terminal and it does have 1 thing that strikes me most - 3 large electrifying photos of lightning decked the walls of the waiting hall leaving a strong impression.
Davao City airport in the Philippines is spacious queues are minimal pre check in. After check in you head upstairs to the departure area pay your departure tax and pass through security. You then find yourself in a the domestic departure area where there is plenty of seating and TV screens. Flight announcements are limited my flight was delayed by 2 hours yet there was no announcement to advise.
From and to Singapore on Silk Air. This is a functional airport which in the Philippines is high praise! Security checks are numerous and slow as everywhere in the Philippines but because of the small number of international passengers moves quite quickly. The same can be said for check-in baggage claim and immigration. Toilet facilities are sufficient and clean. On the downside for those who need shops there is only one very small cafe before immigration and a kiosk selling very basic items in the gate area. All in all a good facility in the Philippines.
International flight from SG. Arrival quick but when passengers started to queue up for immigration the lights in the hall were switched off. The only thing that lit the hall was the sun from the windows. After 10 minutes of darkness someone finally realized they needed to turn on the lights. Departure was ok except for the time consuming queue for x-rays. Basic international airport. There's room for improvement.
Departures area uses natural light the main drawback is the layer of security personnel and the number of X- ray machines being used. Check-in counters are looking battered. No area for wait listed passengers. Stores are outrageously priced. Pre-departure lounge is getting to be a bit crowded with a wifi that is not really working and toilets that either are not fixed or smell. The airport is looking like a giant billboard of advertisements. Tourist information area may need further improvement.
I like the design it is being upgraded in terms of services given by the Airport Authority and soon I expect they open International destination in our region.
Arrival to the airport got me the wrong impression of the airport since arrival hall was almost non air-conditioned and with old facilities. Baggage collection slow and hall was dim (but it was 0305 in the morning anyway). Departure hall was the opposite but security was extra-tight following the bomb in 2003. 5 check-points (1st-Searching taxi boot 2nd-When getting off taxi 3rd-Before entering airport 4th-Immediately after entering airport 5th- After checking in and going upstairs 6th-(Optional) Final handchecked point for Silkair passengers) before getting to the lounge. Signage was very good and clear. Plentiful gates and check-in desks. However I was shocked right before the 3rd checkpoint that we had to pay for a mandatory Terminal Fee of Php 550. I thought they would include it into the airline ticket. I ran out of money and was forced to exchange money at the store inside the airport. The lowest possible rates was there they must have earned a lot. Davao Airport is not very good especially with such a high terminal fee. No seats in the arrival hall (for people picking us up).
Check-in is a breeze? I pass there every two weeks and never meet any breeze. Airport tax is 200 Pesos domestic and 550 international a blow in the face of so many people. Increasing over more than 500%! Guests who come to pick me up were send out from the arrival hall like dogs to wait in burning sun with no place to sit or have a drink. A lack of stores and restaurants inside the terminal. Davao International Airport is the only airport where you get your shoes x-rayed twice before you can pass.
Davao International Airport is the only airport where you get your shoes xray'd twice. You have to remove shoes and xray them to gain access to the check-in area. After check-in you move to your departure lounge area and then go through another xray and physical baggage check and again off with the shoes and through the xray machine. Why is this done twice. It causes a backlog at the xray machines as people are trying to get shoes back on and their baggage is clogging up the machines.
The first security check outward bound is on the approach road and includes a search of the taxi boot and a request to examine passports. This is all very reassuring and necessary following the terrorist bomb in 2003. The terminal building is excellent
Much nicer than the old airport but issues with security after x-ray they did a hand check because I had AA batteries in my camera which were confiscated. That was a first of course he didn't take the other batteries I had in the case. There is an eating place after security it's the smoking lounge which is OK if you can stand the pall hanging over you. Waiting area is better than NAIA 1.
Good Modern Airport. About 20 minutes to downtown. Has a domestic and international section. Due to security reasons arriving and departing passengers have to get off and on in the parking lot and walk under the sun for about 50 meters to the terminal despite ample arrival and departure space. Not very sensible in my opinion. Airport tax is 40 Pesos but there are rumours it will be raised to Php 200. Once past the 2nd floor security checkpoint where they have a bunch of stores and foodstall there is no place to get food in the waiting lounges.
The new Davao International airport which opened last year is way much better than the old one. parking is plentiful. check-in is a breeze. everything is computerized and the level of comfort surpasses of that the manila centennial terminal 2 (NAIA II). The only drawback is the lack of stores and restaurants inside the terminal.
Its easy to get around very friendly people and easy to get bags and leave. Always a good experience and they have free wifi so never a problem with communication.
This airport on Florida's East Coast is a beautiful little facility! Upon deplaning I was greeted by a small but spacious and superbly appointed six-gate terminal which was quite welcoming. The terminal is remarkably well-maintained and is very user-friendly with nice short distances good signage and a few clean shops to pick up a magazine or a quick meal. The personnel (both Delta and the airport security) were some of the most courteous airport employees that I have seen in a while with an genuine eagerness to serve. The only downside to DAB is the relatively small number of airlines and flight choices
A nice airport very clean. Weather is often bad but the airport cant control that. Has a delicious restaurant and a nice little gift shop. The luggage claim was a little slow and they took one of our pieces of luggage to the check-in counter without informing us. Other than that a very nice little airport.
"Very clean, relatively new airport with quick efficient service. On arrival, through border control and collected bags within 30 minutes. On departure checked in and through security within 20 minutes. Plenty of seating at gates and good choice of food and drink, although not cheap! Toilets are spotless. Overall a good airport."
"Arriving into Delhi (T1) was a bit of a shambles, particularly in trying to secure a prepaid taxi, there was really no queue to speak of. However, I was so pleasantly surprised when departing from T3 (domestic) - particularly with the seamless connection on the Metro. The building itself is quite modern and new, the selection of eateries and shops (both before and after security) is good and there are lots of bathroom facilities near the gates. Our flight was at 2am so the airport was fairly quiet and there were no long queues anywhere, the only issue was that a number of cafes were closed for the night. The need to get a paper tag for each item of hand baggage and have it stamped going through security is a bit of a pain."
The airport is huge but they make you walk all the distance. They advertise free wifi for 45 minutes but unable to connect. Tried with mobile as well as laptop. There is little space to sit near the gates at Terminal 1D. I think they should have paid more attention to the design. 
"Used international terminal and was pretty happy with the overall experience. Quick check-in, clean facilities and surprisingly excellent duty-free and cheap eating options were a nice treat. The only issue was that collecting baggage after arrival is very slow and needs improvement."
"What a terrible sight and experience after returning to India after just 6 weeks out. Moment you step out of the aircraft the personnel, especially the policemen look so sloppy and clumsy. Why do they need to be there even? Immigration and customs were OK, though again the officials look so unprofessional. The toilets are not so clean and the staff look shabby. The operators of the battery carts are not bothered to look out for elderly passengers to give them a ride, what a contrast from the airports where they go out of their way to help elderly passengers. The persons at the eateries are equally sloppy and clumsy in their work and talk. The security staff (police) keep standing in groups and chatting. Their standing poses are so unprofessional. DIAL provides complimentary service to the domestic terminal but they actually only give you a coupon to be used for the regular DTC bus. You have to wait for a long time and the DTC person sitting behind a table is unable to help about the timings, he is busy on his phone even at 1 am! Very depressing to arrive into India. "
"I use this airport frequently and standards seem to have slipped of late. The airport on the whole is great but security staff can be rude and daunting. I was not aware of this 6 hour prohibition of entry before a flight. Like at most third world airports everyone gives a different answer. Staff are helpful but not very professional or organised. It is true that not every staff member is well informed. Keep an eye on the display board for flight timings. I have never experienced erroneous displays leading to missed flights. You should know your flight timings and arrive at the boarding gate in good time avoid missing your flight. Only a fool would wait for a final call announcement over the PA system. However Airline staff would do well to announce delays. My Emirates flight was once delayed for 2 hours hours and the Emirates staff did not bother to show it on the board IGI also needs more flight info screens and for those driving to the city a petrol pump to gas up for the drive to the city. The Metro rail service should be extended to Rajiv Chowk in downtown Delhi. The present service terminates at New Delhi station and one wonders how to travel to the City centre. The shuttle service to the domestic terminal is good. Carry a photo ID when visiting the Airport as you will need to a photo ID for entering the visitors area. DIAL needs to maintain standards. Security checks are a fact of life in India. India unfortunately needs it like mozzie repellent spray. On the bright side despite heavy crowds there are seldom traffic snarls. Taxi booth operators need to be more polite and welcoming. Most things in India start well and then degenerate. It is the same with the Metro link to the City. No traffic wardens and no customer service staff. Regrettably customer service standards at Delhi Airport have fallen and the officialdom is more interested in a ""feedback"" than in fixing things that have gone wrong. Delhi Airport has gone from an A to a B+."
"We came to the airport (terminal 3) early hoping to use a Star Alliance Lounge because my wife and I have Gold status and to talk to a Thai Airways rep if we can get on an earlier flight. Instead we are told by security that we cannot enter before 6 hours into the main section of the airport. Instead we are restricted to a ""guest lounge"" section of the airport with minimal AC and flies flying around. We are told to call the customer service number that they have written on a paper for Thai Airways. We call the number and that doesn't work. We then are pointed to a couple kiosks that seem to be 3rd party ticketing agents. As we stand in front of the Celebi kiosk waiting to be helped 5 representatives are sitting make eye contact with us and don't even bother to greet or ask if we need help. We then call the airport customer service line and they contradict what security has been saying and say its 8 hours before the flight that you can enter the main area. I have travelled around the world and this is the first time I've experienced such a rule where you cannot enter the main section of the airport unless its 6 hours from your flight or less. While waiting in front of security in frustration we watch dozens of other foreigners wanting to do the same to enter earlier to talk to a ticket agent or other reasons and see the same reaction. A look of frustration and disgust. You really have to wonder if this airport really cares about what foreigners think and if they'll ever be back as a tourist after experiencing such stupidity and lack of customer service."
Delhi Airport is extremely clean organized modernized and at par with the international standards. Its the best airport in the Indian subcontinent. I would always prefer to transit from Delhi anytime I come to North India.
Frequently use the International Terminal (T3) at IGIA. In comparison with BKK MNL and even certain Schengen zone airports such as ZRH GVA CDG FCO DEL scores highly. The cleanliness is good. Staff interaction with customers is mixed but DIAL staff on the whole are helpful. Immigration queues are short and generally well managed and quickly dispensed with. Security Checks take time and prove to be a bottle neck but better to be safe than sorry! I don't really shop there but its enjoyable to walk around and browse the shops. Food options seem decent enough lots of veggie options always makes me happy. The vending machines have been known to swallow up hard earned rupees. The biggest drawback is in the arrival lane. it is always chaotic outside. No one seems to be using the tower car park everyone just jams up their cars in the arrival lane. DIAL must look to ensure better traffic management of those cars and persons coming to receive arriving passengers.
Infrastructure and other facilities are good enough. What do you expect when you are in a connecting flight and our departure airport has checked through your luggage to your destination? Obviously you do not care for it and just collect it at you destination isn't it so? But no not here first of all you need to find the respective airline and give him them your luggage tag and all other information then they will fill in a form and then submit it to transfer desk. If you are provided with a transfer boarding card at the check in counter what do you do? Obviously you go to transit lounge and wait for your flight. But no not here. If you show your transfer boarding card here they simply say that it will not work here. They think boarding cards issued by them are the only ones valid. Getting this boarding card is not easy. During my last trip I had a 12 hour long flight to Delhi and had 6 hour of transit at Delhi and my small 1.5 years old daughter was not feeling well but because of above issues I had to wait for 3 hours just to reach the transit lounge. They need to make the airport passenger friendly.
Arrived here from Dublin via Abu Dhabi. A week later departed on domestic flight to Goa. Then arrived and transited to flight back to Dublin via Abu Dhabi. When we landed it took a while with the bus to get to terminal. It was early morning in winter so wasn't too hot fortunately. A few flights seemed to have arrived at same time so there was a long queue at immigration. But there were plenty of staff working and they were very polite. Domestic terminal for flight to Goa was a little chaotic. But terminal is bright and clean. Security is heavy but understandable. Good range of cafes in domestic terminal. On return transited from domestic to international terminals. Quite a long distance. Had to wait a long time for bus and it was very cold outside. International terminal was very pleasant experience. We arrived there at 11pm and our flight wasn't until 4am. But we were able to check in early and go through security. Duty free shops had a great selection and very cheap. Walking distances were short enough within the terminals as well. Overall a pleasant experience. And a great contrast to Abu Dhabi which was chaotic overcrowded and very expensive.
Seen many airports around but this one is the best among them. You will never see crowded immigration counters no fussy check-in counters no headache travelling to airport (as you have multiple options). Crowd management is one of the best here. On cleanliness front it can beat any other airport in the world. I found duty-free here much cheaper compared to other airports.
This airport is definitely the best in India and measures up impressively against others such as Istanbul Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur in terms of space cleanliness security eating options and ease of movement. I frequently use both the domestic and international terminals and have not even once found the toilets dirty or smelly. There are always plenty of people ready to help you out in case of doubts. Signage is excellent. The duty free is excellent and definitely offers better bargains than the other airports which I have mentioned and used. The terminal also offers good views of the airside for those interested. The only thing that leaves you confused is the choice of carpet colours!
I have started most of my international journeys through this airport. After having visited several international hubs (LHR CDG DXB AUH SIN HKG BKK KUL CMB) I have to rate Terminal 3 of Delhi Airport one of the best among them. This is a busy airport in terms of flight and passenger volume. Despite this I have never seen this airport very crowded be it check-in counters immigration desk security channel or boarding gates. This is due to the fact that the terminal is very spacious. It has a large number of check-in counters immigration desks and boarding gates. The airport is ultra-modern and very clean. The interiors are great and no less than the interiors of Terminal 3 LHR Terminal 2 SIN or DXB. They have sufficient number of restaurants duty free shops. You are never short of seats once you clear immigration. I hate its traffic which makes the flights wait for longer during take off and keep hovering in air for some time during landing. I think they need to make additional runways functional. Another bad thing about this airport is for transit passengers. If you are transiting through this airport to another destination you may not get proper guidance from staff for new boarding gates. This is mostly to Air India passengers as this airport is the transit hub for Air India. This is the problem of Airline and not the Airport Authority.
Terminal 3. Passed through Delhi on my way from the US to a domestic Indian destination. As an overseas Indian I can honestly say this facility makes me proud of my home country. The terminal is ultra modern to and very efficient. Immigration at the airport took me a maximum of 5-10 minutes the shopping is excellent as are the restaurants. Bathrooms are kept extremely clean by staff who are always in the bathrooms to clean up after individual passengers. The staff from the immigration officials to the airline staff are professional and helpful. This airport is up to international standards - a pleasure to fly both in and out of.
Delhi Terminal 3 is great. Clean spacious and a lot of food options. Airport staff are friendly. However there are various check points (5-6) which takes some time. Restaurants are fairly priced and I will surely use this airport again.
I frequently travel through Delhi Airport and in my opinion it is excellent. I don't really understand so many negative comments. Yes the queues can be quite long and security tedious but the actual airport and the facilities are great. Ground staff are friendly and courteous. Immigration do try and speed things up. Security can be a bit rude. There are a lot of shops which offer an immense amount of products. The Duty Free is also of a very high standard. There is also a large food court offering many cuisine's. Toilets are very clean. Lounges offered by the airport are also very good. Overall excellent airport. Not yet up to the standards of Changi and Hong Kong but in my opinion definitely better than lots of Western European/American airports. An excellent new hub for the Star Alliance.
Transit Lounge B of the international terminal - you will sit and wait interminably for someone to take pity on you and issue you your boarding pass for your next flight. It is apparently up to the airline you will board how long they will take to notice you. Two three hour waits are normal in a lounge bereft of anything in the way of amenities except for a vending machine. I would have lodged a formal complaint only the complaint box had no forms and no one would bring me some. A hint to cope with this situation if you have an Indian visa go out through immigration and come back through the check in counter. It will save you hours. Bottom line you certainly do not feel that your status as customer means anything to the staff.
I travel though DEL frequently and have rarely had any troubles with staff. Terminal 3 is enormous and probably better than some ones such as O'hare or JFK. I do agree that there are a high number of security checkpoints but I would rather feel more comfortable being safe than sorry.
"The security at this airport is ""crazy"". You have to go through 8 or 9 security gates even before you get to the check in counter of your airline. We were a couple of hours early arriving at the airport and the security staff wouldn't even let us in. The staff were rude and ask you rude personal questions which are not related to travel. The new terminal T3 which is fairly new but the check in area seemed to be outdated. The floors were dirty and not cleaned properly. Its a big airport handling a good number of passengers every day authorities must take steps to make it passenger friendly rather than scaring them off by their employees and security."
Worst airport ever. Security is crazy I wet through 8(!) checks. The main proof was a print out email. Security didn't let me in as I was too early. Security and staff rude.
One of my favourite airports. Spacious and efficient. The washrooms are very clean. Areas that need improvement are (1) Duty Free Shopping Variety (2) Acceptance of USD / GBP / AED at the vending machines.
Had a fabulous experience transiting through DEL. Queuing was surprisingly efficient during the early morning hours. Loads of shopping/eating opportunities. I can see this airport becoming a major air hub in the near future. Highly recommended!
Beautiful efficient world class airport. Passengers should acknowledge the fact that the stringent security measures are for good reason. Excellent facilities.
I have traveled almost the entire world and can easily put up my hand and vouch for this airport to be the best. Close second would be the Singapore Changi airport. Excellent modern building with very efficient security measures. I have read reviews here where people have criticized this airport for being too strict but this is for good measure and I think it cannot be ridiculed for it. I have experienced worse (stricter and longer) queues in Heathrow than the T3. The best in the world when it comes to the facilities for passengers with longer transit hours very reasonably priced (compared to it's counterparts in Europe Asia and North America). T3 really is a thrill for any traveler.
This relates to T3. We arrived International with a Domestic Connection. Immigration queues were short and did not take as long as last year our baggage arrived reasonably quickly but in order to catch our T3 domestic flight (same terminal) we had to go landside recheck in our bags and then go through landside security. This is stupid and takes a long time - why do they not have airside connections to Domestic we wonder? Hence the three hours connection time we had was only just enough. The airport itself has a reasonable range of facilities there is free wifi but you need a working mobile in order to use it (a security code is sent to your mobile).
Used DEL twice in the last week for international arrival and domestic departure. I still think this airport is great after 3 years. Lots of security checks but I would rather have that than be sorry later. Security staff not overtly friendly but their job isn't to be nice but thorough. I like the shopping which is pretty vast and found prices to be fair. Had a nice Indian lunch for Rs 200 ($ 3.50) which is significantly cheaper than a meal at any US or European airport. Boarding areas and bathrooms all clean. Arrival was also easy with 3 lanes reserved for business/first class passengers. Finished customs and immigration in 35 minutes and got a cab to central Delhi on 5 min.
Its a truly international standard airport we have been to it recently. I am impressed with the cleanliness of washrooms. World class toilets and staff keep them clean ongoing. Also the sitting facility is good. Food court is clean and food prices are reasonable. Overall I liked the airport and would like to recommend to travellers.
DEL T3 is much better than what they had before. It is certainly more pleasant although the carpet color and design seems a bit too loud. The lines did seem a bit longer but nothing that one shouldn't expect. Airport seems to have more choices in terms of restaurants but unfortunately the prices are blatantly high. That is something that they should seriously look at. I think they are using international standards when it comes to pricing. Sadly that is not quite the same when it comes to customer service. I still found washrooms well below par and there were pigeons flying around inside the terminal. If you haven't used DEL before make sure you take the print out of your ticket with you otherwise you will not be allowed inside the terminal. Seems like DEL is the only airport to do that. Although I do understand that they only want to allow the passengers to get inside the terminal. Overall IGI T3 is a big improvement over the old airport but there is a big room for improvement.
I regularly fly to Delhi Airport. It is an excellent airport with many facilities available. T3 is a lot better than the old airport. Signage is clear and present in all areas of the airport. There are also lots of screens showing flight departures/arrivals. Bathrooms are found in all corners and are extremely clean. A lot of seating is available and there are a lot of shops present at the terminal. Delhi Duty free is very good - lots of products are available. Many good restaurants are in the terminal - serving Indian and international food. however immigrations queues are extremely long and can be a pain. security is also tedious and security staff can often be quite unpleasant. On the plus side airport staff are extremely courteous and helpful. Lounges are also good. The terminal is aesthetically stunning.
In transit from LHR to BKK with Air India. Good points - despite fog no delays except last leg back to LHR by 90 minutes. Clean well laid out airport with good signage and many flight information boards. Toilets clean and well maintained and no sign of cleaners loitering for tips as previous comments. Bad points - international transit. As other reviewers point out this is a slow process with officials taking an inordinate amount of time to do repeated checks. Outbound there was minimal queue (maybe 20 people) but still took 20 minutes to get through. Inbound had 2 flights ahead of me - 60 minutes to get through. For fellow travellers note there are 3 different security checks - ask officials if can go to right if first has a large queue (its not signed or obvious). Also make sure you have baggage tabs on your hand luggage and you get a stamp once your bags are screened - if you do not have this you run the risk of missing your flight depending on the attitude of the staff at the gates (I saw a fellow passenger sent back to get this and she missed the flight to BKK to my knowledge). Long walks between gates so once boarding starts you need to start going to the gate.
Delhi has a nice airport. However make sure you arrive 3 hours before departure. Check in and security checks can take time. Its been Delhi's bane for years. If you need to exchange rupees for foreign currency the choice is not wide and limited mostly to USD and EUROs. There is a Thomas Cook counter close to the entrance and a short walk from check in areas. The airport needs ATMs and Bureau de Change kiosks in the transit and departure lounge following immigration and security. Do not carry a stash of Indian Rupees unless you need to spend it at the airport and exchange them for foreign currency before you go through immigration and security. Or else you could get stuck with Indian rupees on your way out. The Airport seriously needs to think of ATMs and more forex counters in the departure and transit area. Also a Reliance webworld like the one at the old T2 will help. Printers and copiers will be nice too. Surprisingly there is no Business centre at this airport. Very strange. Delhi is slowly getting to be a transit airport so these facilities are called for. The train service to New Delhi railway station is good too. The departure area offers luggage storage for a nominal fee. If you are transiting to the domestic terminal( Low cost carrier terminal which is a few Kms from T3) make sure you have a minimum of 4 hours between flights. Travel to the domestic terminal and queuing at the domestic terminal can eat up a good 2 hours That said IGI Airport is a good airport to travel through. Reasonably clean efficient uncrowded and polite. There is always room for improvement but unlike many airports in the region and in contrast to some overrated 4and 3 star international airports this airport has no nasty surprises.
"The best airport in India I have been to there is no bus transfer from domestic to international like BOM still has. Security checks are plenty the cabin luggage screening is a huge mess with shoving and pushing from all sides it is not clear how efficient these checks are and what the purpose of funny paper tags with a stamp on every bag is. If they are so important why are only 2 of our 4 bags actually checked at the time of boarding. Immigration is equally confusing. You are supposed to fill a form nobody tells you that you have to fill it and the form is not available anywhere. Same thing happens when you try to leave the country - you have to plea to a number of staff to actually find out the secret of which other staff member is hiding the forms. The form to leave the country again needs the same information as you gave for the visa application. The Immigration officer then told me it was the duty of the airline to hand out these forms. International to domestic luggage is not checked through even though this was confirmed to me at the time of check-in in BKK by Air India staff. Leaving India it was checked through as well as for international to international transfer. To recheck you bags you have to pick them up and walk them all across the building to some dedicated transfer counters. While walking in the terminal make sure not to stumble over the large gaps in the floor. I was also surprised to find large amounts of staff in washrooms that are labelled ""not for staff"" they are mostly passing time and chatting away. For wifi you can actually select you country to get the password sent to you cell phone but it only worked on 2 out of my 3 times there. Still if you have a choice as to which airport in India you are going to Delhi is probably a good choice."
"Was surprised by the ""random security"" check at this airport. 5 of us after visiting Delhi flew together to Hong Kong using Jet Airways. We spent a long time at the International security check-in counters due to the long queue and only 1 out of 3 counters allowed for ladies it then took over 15 minutes to walk to the appropriate gates. About 30 minutes before the boarding time 3 of us were advised that we were selected by the Custom for random check we were accompanied by Jet Airway staff and walked us all the way back to the security check-in counter with our baggage queue up and checked again as per normal travelers then run back to the boarding gate to catch our plane - luckily just before the door closed. It seems New Delhi Airport is the only one with such special arrangement. Maybe this is one of the various reasons it can only be the second best airport."
Strict security so much so that our passport photos were checked three times by the same person at different stages of our passage through. Also as it is not allowed to take Rupees out of the country it would help if Thomas Cook staff would change ones money for you. They seemed most reluctant to change money into sterling trying instead to give Euros or Dollars. Eventually we managed to get Scottish notes as long as we had a minimum of £40 so we had to club together with another traveller. Airside we could only use sterling notes but change would be given in Rupees. How daft is that! The airport itself is a modern building with good facilities but let down by its staff.
First of all I must mention that T3 is an enormous improvement on the old terminal. It is well laid out and very spacious. I'm not sure about the brownish carpet throughout though! With a few improvements mainly in attitudes it might one day achieve the status of some of the better airports like Singapore although I'm not holding my breath. First of all immigration and security staff need to learn manners. Security staff in particular are incompetent and surly. Secondly toilet attendants need to attend to their cleaning duties instead of hovering about trying to extract tips. Thirdly WiFi needs to be free. There is supposed to be free WiFi for 30 minutes. However the PIN code was not fully sent to my mobile phone and as a result I was not able to log on either at the time of my first visit or upon my return visit a fortnight later. Finally FX facilities need to be provided in the departure area after immigration so people have the possibility of converting unused Rupees into an alternative currency since it is not possible to exchange those in one's home country and it would appear taking Rupees out of India is actually illegal!
Very good airport. Very nice interiors. Immigration officials not very friendly. One of the best in Asia.
I had to use Delhi for domestic and international transfers. The Airport has still got smelly carpet which they need to change. The toilets were clean and better than Heathrow. The security queues at international transfer was really long and as well as the queue for lift to domestic transfers. They need to introduce more lifts to domestic transfers as one lift is not sufficient for international passengers. The food court is impressive and caters for world cuisine. Elderly people have a nightmare at this airport due to long walks. This can be overcome by introducing shuttle services to gates from security gates. The security personal were polite and interactive. Overall I am impressed with Delhi.
Another flawless experience at T3. Second trip at this airport this month and overall nothing to complain about. Clean layout functioning clean wash rooms enough to eat and drink - basically whatever one needs from an international airport. Recommended.
Terminal 3. Beautiful big efficient airport that works well except for one fatal flaw: the security arrangement in the transit zone. I strongly encourage anyone thinking of flying a route that involves connecting in Delhi to avoid this airport altogether by finding another route. It is massively inefficient slow incompetent and aggravating. The worst airport security set-up I've experienced except for Heathrow Terminals 3 and 4 in London which come a close second. It is under-staffed poorly designed and the people working there are obviously poorly motivated have poor technical training no common sense and no understanding about how to treat passengers like human beings. Yes India has good reason for lots of security but there are better ways of doing it and this is one place to avoid. The poor ratings below relate to the transit security set-up and its effect on the overall airport experience.
A very busy place. Queuing time very poor almost 2 hrs. Suggest there were more staff to help speed up the process. Bags check and body search very thorough which is good but need to increase staffing.
I have been to this airport on numerous occasions each time my gate is towards the end. The good thing is that there are plenty of travelators all around and getting to the gate gets easy. The complimentary water bottle and newspaper received just before boarding the aircraft is appreciated. Security is tight but I think that is needed plus it gives you a sense of relief when you know that everyone has been checked properly.
"International transfer airside. I transited through Delhi airport on my way to Kathmandu in August. Arrival time was 9.45pm. The Transfer Desk was total chaos with no lines lots of people standing in front of the counter and unresponsive staff. My flight was with Jet Airways. It was not clear who was a Jet Airways rep there. Overall Delhi was disorganized time consuming and unfriendly. On my way back the stop was in Mumbai. Arrival time 5.00 pm. No Transfer Desk here but the Jet Airways staff directed us the whole time. We made a line where our boarding passes were marked ""DT"". The security line was fast. The process in Mumbai was efficient organized and fast. Delhi airport is newer Mumbai is undergoing renovations but the transit process was superior and very good in Mumbai."
Travelled in July and August 2013 and had to pass through Delhi airport 3 times for transfers. 3 times it was awful. Took 1.5 hrs to pass security. Checks for hand luggage was so slow. So inefficient. Couples were split up because you had to be completely body searched by a woman in another row. No one speaks English. If you transfer you need at least 2 hours for connecting flights. Security is good but this airport is a mad house.
The airport feels like any of the best airports in the world. It is vast and clean and has enough facilities to keep you occupied no matter how long your lay-over. The security is tight and some of the rules (like having a printout of your boarding pass) may be cumbersome but they do not hassle too much.
First trip to Delhi since the new airport opened. Marked improvement over old facility. Good Points: New and clean facility multiple shops and restaurants (most with Indian cuisine). Lines were not too long. Chairs to lie down while you are waiting in T3 terminal. Clean wash rooms Custom check was brief and courteous. Yes they do have Starbucks in T3 terminal. Low Points: Long walks every where from deplaning to custom and on return long haul to the plain. Restricted choice for non Indian cuisine.
Delhi airport is generally a pleasant experience except for one rotten Apple i.e. the Security check. It it's totally unprofessional manned by inept staff who are more clerical than security staff. Most of the counters are unmanned with more supervisors than actual workers. The inefficiency had to be experienced to be believed. All in all spoils an otherwise decent experience.
Always been a breeze to use. Airside shopping is fairly impressive and diverse as are food offerings. The abundance of air bridges is an added advantage. Baggage claim is quick. Cityside is fairly well organized (and no touts!) and thanks to the airport express getting to the city centre is a breeze. Easily the best in the region and beats other airports I've used like the Paris (CDG ORY BVA) and Barcelona.
T3 International. Good clean layout fast immigration checks plenty of eating options and clean toilets. Not much more one can ask for international level airports. Overall a highly satisfying experience.
Transited en route to and from Kathmandu. My First experience of Delhi and I was most impressed. Everywhere clean and spacious with courteous staff. The baggage transit system functioned well with my bag being transferred from my Emirates flight to my Jet Airways flight seamlessly - even though I was not on a through ticket. En route home to Manchester I used the executive lounge where the shower and the food was excellent.
IGI Airport was very clean spacious and welcoming to me when I first arrived there. It is a beautiful airport and when you arrive you can tell that a lot of time and hard work was put into building the airport. I would definitely want to travel to IGI again.
I can't enough of Delhi airport. Never took me more than 10-15 minutes to get my boarding pass. Immigration did not take more than 10 minutes. Security is where they are very strict though it feels safe when you know that everyone is frisked thoroughly. Lot of shops cafe restaurants to shop and eat. Very reasonable price. Would recommend definitely.
Excellent all round experience spacious interiors roomy good food and beverages. Easily one of the best airports around.
I was in Delhi Airport in December and January and both experiences were great. Upon arrival from BKK I walked to Passport control and waited about 10 minutes before being cleared. I was impressed with the new terminal (T3). Upon leaving India in January I arrived at the front doors greeted by an armed guard asking for my flight itinerary. I did not have it printed but I showed it to him on my iPhone and had absolutely no issues getting in. Checking in was a breeze and passport control/security was fine. Took about 20-25 minutes to get through so make sure you are there at least 2 hours before in order to get to your plane on time. Once I cleared security I was amazed. This new terminal is like nothing I have seen. Huge beautiful design clean (which is rare in India) a lot of shops and eateries everywhere and very nice staff. I am a smoker and I loved the fact that the smoking room was an enclosure that was outside. About 4 years ago when I came I absolutely hated IGI but this new terminal has changed my mind.
"We arrived here via Jet Airways on our way to Singapore. I must say that I was greatly pleased with the hospitality and service. The new T3 is a total game changer for India and the rest of the region. I was there in the early morning hours and it was a very pleasant experience. Staff at several points offered a kind ""good morning"" and a smile. In few years I hope to see them rival airports such as Changi and Incheon (but probably not until the other terminal - T4 is constructed and airline reputation improves) which will improve facilities for domestic flights. The artwork and sculptures inside are just stunning combined with beautiful carpeting. Prices in the duty free are very reasonable and the terminal offers an amazing selection of brands to shop from. Hope to see Mumbai develop into something like this very soon! Great job Delhi! I would happily transit through here next time."
You need time and patience on this airport plan a lot of time to make your change here. Very important even if you are checked in online you need to get in a line for your boarding pass because your airline is not allowed to let you print out your document. I was told the check-in closes 2 hours before departure I don't know I arrived 25 hours before. When your hand luggage has been screened you get a stamp on your luggage/hand luggage/airline sticker with the date. This stamp will checked before you get on the plane. If you do not have this you are in trouble. So after security you should check your sticker/leaf for the stamp. And you need to get in the line many times. Without air ticket you are not allowed to enter the terminal. For the whole building there are 4 old blind men to check this documents. Imagine how fast this is. Then check is line immigration line security line enter the waiting room designated for your flight than one more old soldier who checks the stamps. I was lucky I did not find any crowd at any time. Every line took me about 3-4 minutes there were only a few international flight out that time (8 am). The terminal is huge to get to your flight you need to walk 2 miles. Many restaurants shops long distances. I found all clean the soldiers were not smiley but friendly.
I have travelled through IGI more times than I can count. Many people complain about the tight security but I feel it is required. The food is relatively expensive. I am not giving a good review just because I am Indian. Generally I am the first person to criticise things in India.
We were on transit at Delhi airport for 7.5 hours while flying from Kathmandu to Narita. The whole setup is flawed and we were stuck there for more then 2 hours to get a boarding pass. Again - it happened at 6 pm and we waited until 8 pm to get the boarding passes. After getting the pass we went to security check. The guard/police sent us back to the desks to get something called Delhi Transfer (DT) written on our boarding pass. When we returned to the desk the lady wrote down DT using a pen. What a farce! Try to avoid Delhi if possible. There is no service and there were half-a-dozen people doing the job or one or two max.
Have travelled a few times through T3 and every time the experience has been quite good and hassle-free. This time arrived at 5.30 am from Helsinki and connected to an Air India domestic at 9 am. Bags were out quickly and immigration was a breeze then quickly upstairs to Air India departures with a security check on the way upstairs - we were at the Air India counter by 6.30 am and had plenty of time until AI departure that was on time. The same story on the way back to Helsinki: easy and hassle-free. Maybe this is due to the fact that Finnair lands in Delhi in the morning instead of midnight and takes off at 10.45 am when there is not that much international traffic at T3. Moreover there are some pleasant eateries and cafes there plus great views to the runways to do some plane spotting. Cannot understand some very negative feedback from fellow travellers about Delhi Int'l Airport. Sure Delhi cannot compete with Hong Kong Singapore Changi KLIA or Bangkok Suvarnabhumi but it's still modern bright rather functional and clean. Security is tight but when you know this beforehand you shouldn't encounter any major problems at Delhi Int'l Airport.
Visited this airport only once and I have to say by far the worst experience ever. Seats broken limited facilities very tight security (especially for us Pakistanis) and a very dirty airport. Stopped there for 3 hours and couldn't bear a minute within the airport at all.
We arrived here on a Virgin flight and generally the airport experience was ok. It took about 35 minutes to get through immigration but the queue was constantly moving albeit slowly. There were plenty of free baggage carts available and clean free toilets although in both cases it did not stop an airport employee trying to get a tip because we wanted to use the free service. Our bags were on the belt when we got through immigration and leaving the airport was easy. We then flew internal from T3 and it was surprisingly easy and orderly. Very short queues pleasant staff and seats in the waiting area for our delayed flight. The drive from central Delhi to the airport took about 30 minutes but the roads were relatively jam free for Delhi on a mid Monday morning. Arriving back a few days later at the Domestic Terminal we were quickly bussed to the terminal our luggage arrived within minutes (it was a full jet so we were prepared for a long wait) and we were quickly out of the terminal past the numerous food stalls outside. Departing from T3 a couple of days later to London was a struggle. Check-in was fast but the queue for immigration took 30 minutes and that for security took nearly an hour – the problem being not enough staff on duty for all of the scanners (and this was at a peak departure time). From arriving at the airport to getting to the gate to 2 ¼ hours. Once airside it was calm and peaceful and we took off on schedule.
Signage is a bit of a problem at Delhi Airport T3. Also the flight information display at the Departure level does not show Arrivals and vice versa. The Radisson Hotel in Mahipalpur where those transiting through Delhi often rest and relax has no flight info displays. Same with the low cost airline terminal. However the Airport is big and spacious and the roads leading to the airport wide and traffic free. A far cry from the former T2.
I've been twice in the last 3 months and it is 2 times too many. I avoid coming to India as much as possible just because of the experience at the airport coming back. The security staff think that the airport is a prison and not a service. The first time I assumed since my airline allowed me to have my boarding pass on my phone/email that I could print it out at the check in or service counters. This is a big mistake as some people have already said. Armed guards will not allow you into the airport without this piece of paper. You can print in an office next to the airport if you have cash. Second time I learned that even with a printed boarding pass it is not enough. If you have no luggage (just hand luggage) you still need to queue for another boarding pass. Both situations could have been avoided by clear communication at time of checking in or at the airport. Leave plenty of time for queuing. You will queue to get into the airport to get your boarding pass to get through passport check to get through security military-style to get through security airline-style oh and there is one final check at the gate of the plane. On Friday I saw somebody refused past that check because there laptop bag had a security tag but no security stamp. I'm not opposed to queuing but the hostility is incredible and the process is slow. I have a lasting memory of seeing 3 booths out of 10 occupied with long queues. One of these the guy was having a nap with his legs on the desk. Somehow if you believe the hype this airport has a great rating. I think it's a horrible experience.
I have travelled through T3 thrice and luckily each experience had been great. The airport is huge swanky and gives an impression of modern India a truly world class airport. The only thing I regret is the security staff wish they get versed in English language and learn how to be chivalrous and genteel with the passengers. Rest it's an overall great experience with nice shops eateries prayer area and other facilities. The airport was a huge surprise. Impressive gateway to Delhi!
Very good experience overall reading some of the people's review regarding security too tight? I rather be safe than sorry. Food was great and prices were reasonable. Some people complaining about prices compare them to Frankfurt or London! We were out in less then hour incl our duty free shopping. Best prices on duty free!
I have been through Delhi airport International and Domestic departure and arrival recently. I am impressed with the facilities better than I expected. At international arrival hall staff are helping people to get luggage I was impressed with their professionalism and helpful attitude. Domestic arrival hall is bit different no staff helping people with luggage still very smooth process. Both international and domestic departure process are similar with other international airports. Here are the downsides. Security is very very tight at Delhi airport. I can understand the reason why but surely these security staff could be more professional and friendly. They are just simply rude! Wifi is only for Indian mobile phone holders they could at least learn from Chinese airport to get temp password if you present your passport. All food and other products are pretty expensive for Indian standard. End of the day it is the people make you feel good not a big departure hall!
While coming from Canada to India I faced three major issues. 1 Being an international airport they expect you to have a mobile connection for wifi access. How do they expect an international traveller to have a mobile connection. Having visited 5-6 international airport around the world I have never seen such restriction. 2 A long queue at immigration always see officers busy chatting with each other. 3 The food is extremely expensive. They should keep the price in accordance with Indian price range. 4 Cleanliness etc. are good but above shortcomings were big enough to make me ignore them.
I transited Delhi on 19th October and 11th November en route to and from Kathmandu. I can only say that I was most impressed. The airport is clean and well laid out and the staff are polite and courteous. On my return journey I availed myself of the executive lounge where I was able to enjoy a refreshing shower followed by a satisfying meal.
In short Delhi airport has been a short and a sweet experience for me in comparison to other airports around the world that look more like a shopping complex than an airport. In my experience it took me less than 30 mins to get out of the airport not a single queue until luggage collection point. I like departures security at the airport gates do not allow any unnecessary people to enter the airport except travellers. Staff helpful and friendly. At check-in they provide help with your luggage. Before you go for immigration there are at three points where you are told about immigration forms. A short and a nice collection of duty free with food court.
"Transited Varanasi-Delhi-London. On arrival at the domestic terminal there are no signs to the international terminal. You have to follow a worn line on the floor to a wooden desk outside the terminal where an airport employee (not wearing a uniform or an ID) inspects your onward ticket and writes you a chit. You then take the chit and walk to an unmarked bus stop (beside a bridge in the open air) where a shuttle bus takes you to the international terminal. The shuttle bus has its quota of scam artists who try to ""help"" you with your luggage and then demand a tip. On arrival at the international terminal you have to show your ticket to the Indian army personnel just to get inside (we had to try to get in three times as the soldiers at the first two gates had apparently never seen BA tickets before). You must also go through another five security checks as well as running the gauntlet of Indian immigration. By a long shot the worst airport I've ever had to transit though."
Terminal 3. Facilities are okay and washrooms are constantly cleaned. Food court is okay the food court in domestic departures has more choice than the food court in international departures which is strange. My main negative point is the attitude of the security and immigration staff. They treat you as a 'thing' and don't speak a word to you. Seems like they don't know the basic words like 'hello' 'please' 'thank you'. If I were airport management I would give them some training sessions communication and people skills!
Very impressed with this airport having used it twice in the last 2 weeks. Roads leading up to it clean and free of traffic check in process for both domestic and international flights well demarcated and easy with few lines. Security took about 5 minutes. Each time security staff said thank you and have a safe flight which I thought was nice. Shops were great and the staff helpful. Airport has lots of eateries from all over the worlds with reasonable prices. Found the lounges to be very nice. It is very large with lots of walking but it is clean and there is a boarding gate for every flight- certainly better than any US airport and most European ones.
Have been in and out of DEL several times in recent past. Queues at immigration always lesser than airports outside India. Washrooms always clean although are used by security staff and other staff as well. Eating choices good and affordable considering that airports in general are expensive world over. Ample space and no sensation/risk of bumping into people unlike several major airports in the world.
It did not matter to me how big or new Indira Ghandi Airport was to me I was not impressed at all. The airport was a major disappointment to anyone using it. The attitude of the workers at the airport is horrible. Check-in workers will just throw your bags on to the belt in front of you. Immigration lines are ridiculous. Locals and foreigners are queuing up together. Locals were mostly cutting through the line and making the line so confusing and packed up that it did not look like a line. No one was there to control the line and immigration workers refused to do anything about it. There was just no system to it. I was glad to leave the airport.
The Transfer area is horrible with no food stalls and no money exchanges. There must be around 50 chairs and when there is more than 1 flight people wait there for 5-6 hrs standing to get to the transit area. There is no customer service. I travelled with my mother from USA and after taking a 17 hrs flight we had a horrible experience. The employees treat you as though they are doing a favour by giving you the ongoing boarding pass or answering any questions.
I frequently use Delhi airport and its terminals 1D and 3 are quite modern compared to old 1A 1B and 2. Security check procedure is still old-school but its much better managed now than before. Terminal 3 is quite long and maybe it could have been better designed to reduce walking time to gates. Further it feels more closed than open and maybe they could improve on natural lighting. Terminal 1D is quite fantastic given everything is fast-track but it lacks facilities as compared to even Terminal 3. In both the terminals they need to improve on maintenance.
I expected a lot from this airport. It looks more of an airport built within a shopping mall. The immigration- and-security check area combined is half of the entire commercial and food area. It took me 65 minutes to get through immigration and security check due to the long queues. I think IGI and GMR lost out on prioritizing the facilities. People don't visit airports for fun and shopping they travel through them and the top priority should be passenger convenience which is in no way top notch.
Travelled to terminal 3 compared to terminal 2 this is brilliant. Large concourse for being dropped off in and entry to the airport was fine - didn't have to queue and security staff was quite pleasant. Check-in was fine no real issues. Had to deposit 3 of our 4 bags in the oversize bags area which were taken by a 'porter'. Immigration is normally an ordeal but in this case no problems at all! The final security check was great the guy doing the pat downs greeting us with a smile and we were done. Wide range of food in the food court and competitively priced duty free items. The reason I suppose is the airport wasn't as busy as it could be and perhaps that accounted for the pleasantness of staff?
There were mosquitoes everywhere I can only imagine how bad it gets during the rainy season. The restrooms were a bit better than some other Indian airports or in India in general but they still smelled and each bathroom could use a dedicated janitor. At immigration two of the guys were busy talking when one of the other immigration officials asked me to go up to them. I did and I was yelled at! The places to eat looked dirty. If given the choice again I would stay away from this place.
I flew to Delhi and then an internal transfer to Amritsar. Rude staff long delays at security and very rude security staff zero customer service. No point having wonderful facilities if the whole process takes so long that you have no time to sit down at the airport! Very stressful. Same story on the way back.
"Very modern airport very efficient with short queues. Great food court at departures. But the BA lounge service was the worst I have encountered. Subcontracted over-crowded poor refreshments and no privacy. There was much more room to ""stretch out"" in the public food court area."
Based on a recent flight from Kathmandu to Sudan via Delhi (return via Mumbai). It's probably fine if you have boarding cards right through but if not then forget it. We were sat for over 5 hours in a transit area in Delhi with nothing but vending machines which only accept Indian rupees (and nowhere to change money). By the time we got through another 40 minutes in security there was barely enough time to get anything to eat. Same story in Mumbai on return except that the transit area was alive with mosquito's and we just about made it to our plane with a 3 hour transit time. I can't really rate terminal facilities as we barely had a chance to see the departure area.
Visited the airport twice in Feb 2012. If you are transferring from Dehli to any other airport in India - don't. We had a 2 hour wait in Delhi Terminal 3 which was taken up by rushing from corner of the airport to the other. There were security checks baggage which had to be checked in again more security checks and long queues and disinterested and unhelpful staff. We managed to board our connecting flight just in time. On the way back from Amritsar to Dehli to London Heathrow. Same story long queues followed by security checks and more checks. For all the new facilities and modern airport Dehli knows nothing about customer service and providing a good experience.
This Airport is extremely regimental. Six Security checks! Security check to get in to Departures At the desk Immigration Border control at the gate and before entering the plane. X-ray staff had a chat whilst ignoring my rucksack that was sitting making me wait. No signage. Duty free staff are disinterested and was greeted with a sour serious face of have a nice flight.
I visited India after about two years and used the new T-3 terminal for the first time. I have to say I was impressed with the facility. But obviously because of its size one has to walk a lot although there are moving walkways. I just wish they had chosen a different color carpet it seems so tacky and old fashioned. Most importantly the queues seemed shorter and staff more helpful. The food a bit overpriced. What remains to be seen is that how long can they maintain the high standards.
Visited Delhi after 3 years and noted a lot of improvements. Clean passageways a bit of a long walk to arrival area perhaps because of its size clean toilets with staff to help immigration and customs was a breeze without any problems. After disembarking I was out of the main gate in just 25 mins. There is room for more cleanliness and maintenance otherwise in a few years it will be just the same as before.
From LHR by Air India. Queues longer than expected. A lot of the airport staff were rude I guess it really is luck what kind of person you get at the kiosks. Airport was clean and there was a good range of duty free shops at reasonable prices. There were plenty of signs making it impossible to get lost. Check-in and baggage claim were easy but immigration took ages. Toilets were nice. Lots of screens updating you on your flight at all times. Overall Terminal 3 was so much better than Terminal 4 at Heathrow.
I have experience of Domestic Terminal 1D. The design was good and we never felt it was the clichéd substandard Indian Airport. The baggage was at the belt within 5 minutes of arrival. The help desk was large and other signage pretty clear. On the city side there are good food and beverage outlets within and in the area outside the terminal. Access to ATM's and Taxi booths were good. However a better signage and guidance system ought to be put in place to avoid confusion to Non Locals. Most Important it was wheelchair friendly. The placement of baggage belts were too close for my comfort. The use of LCD screens could be better with more efficient information. Wifi was weak wen I visited.
I used the airport to transit from international to domestic. The queues on international arrivals are not long and check out was quick but luggage collection took bit longer. On return trip the international airport had big immigration queues. If passengers want to do shopping then check in at least 5 hrs before departure time as it takes longer to get all the formalities done and gates are at very far distance from immigration. The airport is full of all sorts of shops but no point if you are checking in just 3 hours before the flight time. There is no sign of small transportation vehicles to take the able bodied passengers to gates. The passengers were just rushing to their gates in order to catch their flights after security check. The seating area near the gate are clean and coffee shops are around each gate. The toilets were clean in line with international standards. The ground staff of airport is more helpful than the other airports and to my surprise no money was demanded from travellers as we needed the wheelchair at last minute.
Delhi-Singapore-Delhi this week and discovered that Terminal 3 was very impressive - equipped with all modern facilities - clean good ceiling height and friendly immigration staff. But there are areas where it can improve - properly trained and professional staff. Let us not have CISF people - most of them are rude. It will be good to have a force specially trained for Airport security - who can be friendly and strict at the same time. There are many good shops - mostly international brands. The toilets were clean - but could be cleaner.
Dubai-Delhi-Dubai. Arrival in to Delhi at Terminal 3 was a pleasant surprise it was clean and spacious and looked quite modern. It took 10 mins to reach immigration and I went to get my visa on arrival at the desk which was deserted. It took two approaches to the immigration officials to get someone to come to the desk and process my request and took a further hour for me to obtain my visa. It took approximately 1.5 hrs to finally reach the exit which could have been faster had the visa arrival desk been manned. Beyond this everything else was very good. Return from Delhi to Dubai travelling with an elderly passenger. I had made arrangements with airline for a wheelchair I would recommend avoiding the paid porter service unless it is required. The steward who accompanied us with the wheelchair was helpful and stayed with us right till boarding. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I was impressed with Terminal 3.
"Facilities in Departure Lounges - both domestic and international - excellent but the system of making transit pax sit in the ""visitors lounge"" until the security guard chooses to allow you through to check-in might mean you don't have a lot of time to appreciate them. The Visitors Lounges themselves are awful - they don't even have toilets. I was stuck in one for over 12 hrs and was not impressed."
Initial impressions are good. Indira Ghandi International Airport is a modern world class airport. However it is let down by the security. There are checks to get into the airport checks to get to check-in checks to get to passport control and the massive queues at passport control and through security. Whilst most modern airports and airlines suggest check-in 3 hrs before an international flight you need closer to 5 if you want to shop or use a lounge. It is ludicrous!
Very loud. Most of the announcements are unnecessary and irritating. Apart from that why do they have to announce the 'departure' and the 'arrivals' of all flights? How does that information help any passengers waiting for the flights. It functions with minimum announcements all over they world so why not at DEL?
The new terminal T3 is a vast improvement from the old one. Mostly the facilities are fine just about what you would expect as minimum from any modern city airport. However what really exasperates is the security - their objective seems to be to harass the traveler. The awful looking carpets are a bother to drag luggage over it. Other than this an acceptable airport.
If you are not in transit it is airy modern and there is plenty of space. The security checks are frequent and time consuming. If you are in transit- make sure that your bag has been offloaded. I was told at Heathrow that my bag would be booked through Delhi to Bangalore - it was offloaded at Delhi. An announcement 5 mins before my connecting flight was the only information I had which was too late - connecting flight departed and I spent hours being passed from one uninformed official to another each stamping bits of paper etc. Eventually retrieved my bag thanks to the airline representative - not the airport officials. Wasted 6 hours at Delhi.
It has everything several check-in counters security gates bright natural lighting during the daytime shops and areas to lounge and dine. The distances one has to walk is not a problem unless travelling with an infant or older traveller. Windows airside do not give you a good view of the flight operations if you are waiting. On the city side hailing a taxi can be confusing with different lanes for different types of taxis. Similarly making your way to the Metro Station is not easy and locating the Coach boarding point is not easy.
Its clean and the queues were practically non-existent when I went through (they seemed to be manning more counters than there were customers both at check-in and immigration. Yes I agree with some people that the staff have not been trained as well as at other airports and many don't seem to know anything or just want to pass you on to someone else but in general everything at this new terminal is self-explanatory. I found the signage to be clear and sufficient.
A nice modern building full of rude staff and a terrible lack of co-ordination for passengers in transit. One can wait a long time at the transit desk to be given boarding cards to proceed through security to the departure area and lounges - even Business Class passengers are caught-up in this inefficient mess that can last for hours. The security screening area beyond the transit counter is small and congested with long lines. The quality of the business lounges is generally poor unless you're in the Plaza lounge. Other lounges are exposed to the concourse therefore noisy and insufficiently air-conditioned.
Quite impressed with the shiny new airport that came with the Commonwealth Games. A few quirks though. Last place to change money is before security and the retail outlets after don't give great rates. There also seemed to be far more security (6 passport checks) than I've ever experienced.
Used both the domestic and international wings of T3 and never been disappointed. Having seen CDG and BCN DEL is impressive. Special mention to baggage arrival which was very quick and the airport express train is very useful. Never transited so can't really comment on that but as far as point to point flights are concerned DEL is an excellent airport.
Suprisingly I found Delhi's IGI better than most of the European and American airports. On my way from ORD and transfer to domestic was smooth and hassle free. Courteous staff good food court and decent duty free. Delhi needed this and now they have it.
T3 living up to my expectations. New Delhi was requiring such a Fast transport Airport from many years. Thanks to GMR this dream has been engineered. Yet Some reasons make the International Standards feel and Look like National / Urban. Especially The Check out of multi-level parking. The Single Lane run to Exit from Multi-Level Car parking is Absurd. There is a 15min allowance from Payment to Exit time. This Time gets 200% Consumed in the Waiting lane on the Exit path of Multi-level Car parking. The Lane should have been Widened more.
Recently travelled to Dubai on Emirates and was pleasantly surprised by the new terminal 3. Modern clean efficient and crisp. Not comparable to KLIA or Dubai or ORD but a big improvement over the dump (old terminal 2). The staff are efficient no one asked for a tip or bribe. Immigration staff helpful though they take their time. Airport staff definitely polite and friendly. Airtel has a phone bank for free calls to the city. Helpful when you've just landed and don't have local SIM card. Mobile phone kiosk (Airtel) provides sim that cranks up in minutes. There is a Left luggage counter next to the Metro station and staff there are helpful. Downside: Food court pricey. Not much in the way of duty free shops. Immigration still takes times especially at peak hours (Late night & early morning ). Cant tell where the int terminal ends and domestic begins. Prepaid Taxiwallahs mostly courteous. Don't expect flash sedans. ( Some cabs are rickety old Ambassadors) Can do with a few more bureau de change kiosks in the arrival area. More Int dep and arrival info displays needed right around the terminal. If you are flying out of Delhi ALWAYS carry your printed e-ticket or they wont let you in. Carry Indian rupees if you want to snack in the food court. They don't take USD or credit cards. Delhi airport has come a long way and is way ahead of many airports in Asia and the Middle East. Give credit where credit is due.
I am originally from India myself and sadly Delhi and any airport in India for that matter leaves much to be desired. So far I have not used the new T-3 terminal because I have not been back since 2009. Seems like everything that happens there is chaotic from line-ups to get into the airport to boarding your flight. A few things I should warn you about specially if you've never been there before make sure you take your online flight schedule/ticket etc with you. I know it is only a printed piece of paper but the security personnel don't allow you inside unless you have it. No one is allowed inside the terminal unless he/she has a flight and they want to see the proof. Oh yes be ready to be checked at least three four times. Be ready to be approached by employees (from cleaners to policemen) asking for well let me just say some tip. Feel free to say a firm no. While trying to resolve something try to get to the highest possible official. One more thing don't expect any smiles greetings and or hellos (unless the other person is about to be paid).
One of the worst experiences by far that I've ever had in an international airport. Indian government has put a lot of effort into bringing this airport up to par with international standards and it shows in the infrastructure and amenities. Good job to them for that. BUT aside from the infrastructure what really disappointed me and hoards or other passengers around me was the lack of discipline of airport staff lack of knowledge of airport operations and in some cases even their lack of knowledge of English at all. I am an Indian by descent but never had the exposure to learn Hindi over the years. In many instances the immigration and security personnel refused to converse with me in English and kept asking questions in Hindi and looking at me when I did not have a reply. I came in on a connection flight and was flying out to Toronto. I had a total transit time of 2 hrs for the next flight. Although there were numerous staff walking around none were able to assist me in finding my next checkin counter despite my frenzy to catch the next flight. They even had the nerve to tell me that they do not work for the airline and to try and find someone who does. Extremely rude. Finally when I found the checkin counter myself and after waiting 30 mins in line the guy behind the counter tells me I have to fill in some form. When I enquired where to find the form without even lifting his head up says it should be lying around on the counter somewhere. The moment the gate opens its like every man for himself and no order at all. What I don't understand is past the gate and on the walk to the flight there must have been at least 5 points where you are stopped again and asked for passports. I finally thanked my stars when my flight took off and promised myself to pay extra $$ in the future to fly through any other airport but Delhi. I have seen very small cities that have far more organized airports and courteous staff than Delhi.
Changed planes from domestic to international. The airport itself is impressive and a huge improvement compared to the old terminal but the security checks between domestic & international and international and international are badly planned and badly organised: a narrow area with typical chaos endless lines etc. You need 2-3 hrs between flights to get on your next flight even in the daytime when the airport is not busy. The shopping areas are large airy and comparable to many international airports. Moreover we liked the local touches in the interior design very much. If you just have time to enjoy these features due to the badly organised transit and security arrangements.
Domestic departure airport is huge and one has to be prepared for a long trek. The shopping area is pleasant prices comparable to a mall. Check in took 10 minutes and likewise for security.
Arrival smooth and unhindered. Immigration a breeze with plenty of desks open. Luggage arrived within 5 mins of getting to collection area. Departure at T3 also easy. Security prior to the terminal and at the entrance was high but courteous. Check in and information highly visible. Security checks inside quick but not very impressive. The waiting areas are new so look good and there are a good selection of shops and eating places. The place was also very clean which for India is something of a plus.
"I used T3 on four occasions over the past two weeks domestic and international arrivals and departures. Immigration for me has never taken more than 10 minutes. The domestic side I found to be very well supplied with places to eat/drink/shop (felt much more ""complete"" and bustling than the International side). There were a number of good food options in the food court and some good book/magazine buying options. In addition at the domestic exit they now have postpaid Radio Cabs - ie. you pay by the meter for radio cabs Rs 25 per km + Rs 80 airport charge. Not sure if they've switched to post paid at the international side too - but for the previous comment who was complaining about the range of fares to Defence Colony I wonder if s/he was comparing air-con radio cab prices (about twice yellow-and-black cab fare) to old non-a/c-yellow-and-black cab fares - since the former would be around Rs 600 for Def Col and the latter Rs 300. International departures smooth. Check-in/security quick long walk to the gate but place to relax once there. The two things which remain an annoyance are the insistence on printouts at entry and the penchant for stamping tags on every piece of hand luggage both of which I hope someday disappear."
This airport is a zoo and best avoided. It looks impressive from the outside but that is all. Arrival was not too painful - 1 hour queue in immigration then another 30min for luggage. The Forex counters have poor rates. Prepaid taxi counters appear to charge what they want - from 600ruppes down to 300 rupees for a car to Defence Colony and are pretty unhelpful - not the most hearty welcome for the first-time India visitor so it is worth to shop around despite what they will tell you. The return was a nightmare. At first security personnel (police) man every possible point in the airport. They are rude and speak almost no English. If you can show no ticket they will not let you into the terminal building. My husband did not have a printout of his e-ticket and was refused entry. Luckily I had printed mine out and was able to go in and on to teh Air France counter to stomp my feet ( and Air France personnel was helpful to be fair - but security and ground staff appear to be completely separate). More hassle at the security check (again mannned by police) - as a woman I was only allowed to pass a metal detector about half a mile from where i had left my hand luggage (and the boarding pass). Security stamp your boarding card for a reason unknown to me. More police by the gate again checking boarding passes and on the walkway onto the airplane. At that point I was happy to see the back of them. Airside shops are pretty poor - don't wait to buy last minute souvenirs there. Duty free choice below average with prices higher than average (compared to small city European airports). Food choices abysmal - only spotted a branch of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf the insipid Singaporean Coffee Shop Chain charging 150 rupees for a small cappuccino. Seating is hard plastic - at present you are better off lying on the hideously coloured carpet and staring at the cheap looking prefab ceiling.
Do not transit via Delhi. Regardless of amount of time you have during transit you will end up spending 90% of the time at the transit area. I had heard about the problems at the old airport but I was hoping that they would have implemented new transit policies for the new airport - wrong. During inbound and outbound flights I was able to get out of the transit area mere 45 mins before my flight. And if you have a long layover you are stuck in this place with one small food stall where food is bad. No where else I have ever had to spend pretty much locked up like in a jail cell during transit. Even though they have build a nice looking airport the ones transiting via Delhi will never get to explore the airport taste some Indian food purchase gifts and so forth.
IGI's new Terminal 3 is a massive improvement on Terminals 2 and 1D. It's really impressive and easy to use although the carpeting throughout is hideous. Why carpet? Why the vile 1970s design? My concern is that it will all deteriorate very quickly and will end up looking just as bad as other Indian airports - give it 10 years. Why don't the Indian airport authorities believe in on-going maintenance?
London to Bangkok via Delhi - big mistake. On outward journey did not get 2nd leg boarding card was told would get this in Delhi transit - this is chaos taking forever. Had a 4 hour transit stop so no big deal. Foodc ourt many restaurants used rupees that I had from a previous visit to India. On return same scenario confusion at transit gate. I wanted to eat but now only had euro or swiss currency - small curry stall would not take except rupees - McDonalds the same. Went to Thomas Cook foreign exchange but they only change for Indian passport holders!
"The new airport is aesthetically pleasing and impressive. However the airport is yet to be completely finished with shops still in the process of being built with incessant hammering and drilling. Duty free shops expensive and selection is not extensive. Ground airport staff need to be trained to be more professional and take responsibility to answer queries rather than just shrugging and answering in the negative more often than not. The airport boasts wi- fi access but this is only available to pax with Indian mobile connections and not available to those with international ones. On enquiring about this wi-fi issue a senior staff member answered ""Its your problem not mine"" - very customer friendly indeed. Overall a nice airport good for spending an hour or two but frankly I am bored of it already. It is one of South Asia's better airports - but dont compare it to Changi or HKIA Indira Gandhi Intl does not come close to either of the two."
The arrivals experience was smooth - a long walk from the gate to the immigration area but there were many travelators made it quite painless. The height of the ceilings and general sense of space is wonderful. Immigration was smooth: took less than a couple of minutes between arriving and getting through. I had no checked luggage so cannot comment on the wait time for luggage - which I've heard can be very long. Once outside there was no wait for a radio cab which got me home in less than 25 minutes was prepaid and smooth. I ended up spending quite a bit of time in Departures on the way out because I got there a bit early and passport control/security was quick. Entry smooth
Recently transferred at New Delhi airport on flights to and from Kathmandu. Had plenty of time for transfer which is needed due to long corridors taking up to 15 minutes to get to the central area. All transfer passenger must go through security which was quite efficient and to the central area before going back down the corridors to the gate area. It is important to make sure checked bags are recorded so the get on the next flight. The main terminal area looked very impressive at first site however a closer look reveals poor workmanship like cracked tiles torn carpets etc. Ongoing construction is unfortunately destroying much of the floor space. Terminal catering quite good and we thought reasonably priced (but maybe high for India).
Used the new T3 international terminal during a recent trip. You no longer have to deal with the masses outside the entrance doors much more space to move around the check-in area and the security check has been moved to immediately after immigration meaning you no longer have to worry about missing your flight due to security if you go to the lounge. The main terminal area is much nicer than the old one though as another poster has noted the shops are overpriced lounges are nicer as are gate waiting areas. Queue control also seems to be better though I was leaving on a Saturday night when traffic seemed pretty light. Alas there are still some teething problems. My main complaint was the shuttle service from the domestic terminal (1D) to the international terminal. The bus itself is fine but you're dropped off at the very bottom level where there are no luggage carts to be found. This forces you to lug your heavy bags up a seemingly endless series of travelators to the 3rd level - no easy feat when you're tired. There is still insufficient place to sit if you arrive too early to check in for your flight. And although Wi-Fi is free you must have a working mobile phone to obtain a password by SMS - a big problem if you're a visitor without an international-enabled phone. They don't even offer a pay option anymore. And finally I don't care for the gate setup - similar to Bangkok or Singapore where you have a second (useless) security check then a waiting area to sit until your flight is ready to board but the waiting area itself doesn't open until about an hour before boarding. If you're too early there's really no place to sit in the main terminal unless you have lounge access or patronize one of the overpriced restaurants.
Terminal 3 departure area to fairly quiet. Immigration was very smooth at least a dozen counters open for tourists and I was through in about 10 minutes. The rest of the terminal was in excellent condition and at least half the shops were completed and open for business. Easy to get around from the gates and overall a huge upgrade over the old terminal.
I used the new terminal a week or so after the opening. The landside / check-in area is large with room to move but if you are early for check-in then plan to sit on your suitcase. Anywhere remotely looking like seating was filled to capacity with locals sleeping. Once check-in opened then the lines quickly formed although in fairness I have been in slower lines. Landside shops? forget it! Lines of people waiting at passport control has transferred from the old terminal to the new one same people of course! It takes these guys ages to do anything. At one point the line next to mine (and they had been waiting a long time) were told to go to another line because the officer was due his tea break! Security checks are far too slow but faster than the old terminal maybe they are nervous but I think needing to remove a shaver electric lead from hand baggage and sending it through the scanner again is a bit too much! Airside immediate impression is 'wow India have entered the airport excellence challenge' after a while you remember where you are and can easily see where you are. Shops are there but overpriced (cheaper to buy your last minute present in Delhi) no available seats near anything like a coffee shop and the area around the main one was dirty. Further in towards departure gates the areas are very large pleasant and fully carpeted. I wonder if that was good idea since it looked dirty already and with kids spilling their coke (seen many times in the 2 hour airside wait) it wont last long! To give this airport any glowing report now would distract from what it will be like - if I said the waiting areas at the gates and the open areas at landside are the best things at the airport then its a good guide.
Just spent 7 hours waiting in transit lounge at Delhi Airport whilst travelling London to Delhi with Air India and Delhi to KL with Air Asia in circumstances where my wife and I could have and should have spent no longer than 5 minutes in the area. The rule operating in practice is that you cannot transit until the airline which delivered you to Delhi signs you over and you are accepted by the airline taking you out again. This is so even where you are appropriately ticketed and have an internet boarding pass for the ongoing flight. So if there is no one available at your ongoing airline or no one processes your request from the arriving airline you simply sit and wait and are effectively left in limbo. The only way to get through is to constantly harass the staff to keep checking on where matters are for your particular case. You are invariably told each time you approach the desk by the person on the counter that they do not work for the particular airline that you are flying out on and the matter is not their responsibility. Air India appears to be the only company represented in the transit area. Many people are forced to spend long periods (in some cases more than 24 hours) confined in the transit room with no shops or other facilities. This is completely unnecessary where passengers hold ongoing ticketing. No one appears to be in charge or available to deal with passenger transit. You are just locked in a room and left to fend for yourself. I saw many very frustrated and distressed people unable to have their individual transit situations appropriately dealt with. The many individual staff members at the transit desk whilst personally pleasant were incompetent to handle the situation. The whole shambolic situation is a debacle. I was told by another passenger that on one occasion the security staff would not even allow travellers out of the room to go to the toilet for a period in excess of 3 hours.
The new terminal 3 at Delhi Airport is well laid out clean and seems to be up to international standards. Signage is very clear. Immigration and emigration process times are fast. Luggage delivered pretty fast. Toilets clean. Shopping is satisfactory though merchandise variety especially quality Indian products within a reasonable price range could be better. The retail space available in the international section is definitely not some 20K m2 as advertised by DIAL. Not even close. Landside is not yet fully ready.
International terminal 3 is finally a goer. It is an improvement on the previous effort T2 (that would not be difficult). It is new - Indian new (meaning not entirely finished). Where it is finished on close inspection it actually isn't. Departure is an improvement (but not much) as is Arrival (still have the really self important immigration officers but that is true everywhere). Everything is quicker slightly quicker which is better than it was. Luggage still takes a long time to arrive which is mysterious. Departure lounge is amazingly expensive - $6 for a small beer kind of expensive. They have a sports bar which as of now is not actually licensed but they do have a smoking room as a nod to Asian tolerance. Do not look too closely at the fine workmanship as that will only disappoint and whatever you do do not chuckle as chuckling tends to offend too. In all a very Indian effort but still better than the previous effort that was T2. The domestic terminal is actually an efficient (and dare I say it) pleasant experience and quite a surprise. Naturally that will be closing and relocating to terminal T2 in the very near future.
Used the new T3 for an international departure shortly after it opened in July end. While the outlook of the terminal is greatly improved I still had to wait in a long queue outside to get in. They have at least 8 entrances to the terminal but only 2 were open to passengers after checking of tickets and passport. Why not open a few more to ease the flow of passengers getting in!! Once inside another long queue at the check-in counter of Jet Airways who seemed to be checking in all domestic and international passengers at same counters. Security check didn't take very long and I was just in time at the gate to board my flight. The washroom near the gate had no lights. Apparently was still in a state of construction. However being a new terminal it was clean. Advice: Give yourself enough time before departure to have a less stressful departure experience.
I used this airport four times in the past quarter of a year. The international terminal is dirty badly managed simply unsuitable to bear the amount of passengers. Adversely the domestic terminal is modern full of light clean and well organized.
Delhi's new Terminal 3 has finally opened. Lots of aerobridges travelators well laid out baggage hall clean toilets - a truly superior experience compared to the old terminal. I wish they could improve the calibre of people at Immigration and it isn't fully ready (lounges and outlets are still being put into place) but it is an international quality terminal. I noticed that there is now a proper transit area for connecting passengers.
Quite similar experience as any one - food stalls are empty display vague westernized food. Nowhere to go. But still the unmissable Indian experience.
Delhi Airport (International Terminal) was not as good as I thought it would be. I had to spend seven hours in transit area of the international terminal while going/coming back to/from Kathmandu. The international transit wait area has just hard bottom seats restrooms two little light snack stalls and two TVs - no duty free or lounges restaurants/cafes cyber stations sofas etc - all of these are available beyond security on the way to boarding flights which happens only 3 hours prior to the departure time. The transit wait area is a small area and authorities/airline land crew not very helpful - saw some airline crew make fun of a non-English speaking passenger which looks like is a frequent case here sadly. They just opened up a new terminal last week may be the conditions there has improved!
If you are a transit passenger who is going to have to wait for extended periods of time in the transit lounge do not do it. We flew to Bangkok stopping 15 hours in transit. We knew it would be a long wait but did not understand the ordeal we would face. The facilities are absolutely appalling and the staff do not want to know that you are freezing because the air- con is sub zero temperature all night. You are not allowed to use the clipper lounge unless you are business class. No cash machine no currency exchange. Filthy toilets. No information desk unless you have already passed through security check! After 15 hours of begging for help from airport staff customs office and airline staff we were near breaking point. Staff laughing at us. There are other issues for western women which I cannot speak of during this review but you are going to find it most uncomfortable. If you can avoid New Delhi in transit ove night please do. I do not wish our experience on anyone.
This must rank as one of worst capital city airports anywhere. Staff rude security whilst visible is largely ineffective the place is filthy! My advice is touch nothing - get on the plane ASAP and use the facilities on board.
"The new airport at Bali is a credit to the designer and the people who run it, sure there are some minor delays but if you have to wait there are plenty of places where you can get a good meal for around $6 to $8 AUD. We got there at 5.30 am and even then there was restaurants open, if you compare it to the disgrace that is Perth Airport, where the only food is wet sandwiches or microwaved Pizza at certain times then Denpasar airport is ten star, it also leaves the new airport at Kuala Lumpur in it's shadow, once you are through the gates at KL theres a 20 minute fast walk to the planes with only a muffin stand for food, so if you are delayed as we were, we had two hours with only a muffin and water."
"It is a new airport. But when you have passed the immigration, it is an endless walk till you come to the gates. Why? Because you have to pass numerous shops. There is no direct way. Shame on such kind of passenger ""forcing"" to walk by! "
"Surprisingly nice, new airport (domestic terminal) with ample shopping, coffee bars and restaurants. Nice open, modern feel."
"Arrived mid evening, visa on arrival purchase, immigration and baggage claim was very quick - although the crowd was building up behind us. Customs was a little slower but in the end was just a cursory inspection aided by X-ray. Walking thru a 'shopping mall' to arrivals landslide is a pain. The car park station was chaotic but that is Bali. International Departure was easy. Very pleasant waiting area with lots of food/ drink options. Of course it is another shopping mall. Gate lounge was comfortable enough and Singapore Airlines has the boarding by group well organised. One of the many good SE Asian airports."
"Bit crowded in Arrivals. I was in the baggage hall within about 30 mins of landing in the afternoon which is very bad. No wait on baggage but had the usual confusion about which carousel it's on. The monitors showed the planes that had arrived but did not show the carousel numbers where to collect your baggage. After 45 minutes we finally found our bags. On my next flight departure, it's nicer than the arrival in terms of experience. The check in was smooth and not much problem. But, I think the airport need to improve on the boarding system as to make the queue shorter and make people more convenient. Overall, it's a nice airport experience."
Bit crowded in Arrivals but I was in the baggage hall within about 20 mins of landing in late afternoon which is not too bad. I believe the $35 Visa Fee is about to be dropped. (The Departure Tax has already been dropped). No wait on baggage but had the usual confusion about which carousel it's on. No big deal I was pointed in the right direction and was out of the terminal a few minutes later. Taxi system is fine with no waiting involved. Departures were quick and slick with no queuing at all on Air Asia. The Duty Free Shopping area is extensive for a small airport but didn't appear especially good value. Signage isn't great so you have to check carefully to avoid gate screw ups. A better airport than I was expecting.
"First visit to Bali for my Wife and I and first impressions of the airport left me fuming. For the millions and millions of dollars the Government makes through the arrival tax (USD $35) and departure tax ($200K Rupiah) surely they can get their systems right. Firstly the queue's on arrival to get your passport stamped and to pay the arrival tax were staggering. They did have almost all the booths open yet it took at least 35 minutes to get through. Then the fun starts - the monitors showed the planes that had arrived but did not show the carousel numbers where to collect your baggage. There were 4 carousels with hundreds of bags on them and people (including us) were going from carousel to carousel trying to locate their own baggage. Don't bother to ask a Airport employee as they have no idea or just don't answer your question. After 45 minutes (yes 45 minutes) we found our bags. Very frustrating. Yet more frustration on our flight home - we checked in and went through the various 4 or 5 steps even before you get through: check in - go to another counter to pay your departure tax - go to another counter to have the departure tax receipted - go to the next counter to have your passport stamped and then at least your through. But wait there's more - our flight we were advised would leave from gate 11 and we proceeded to gate 11 (which is downstairs). When we got to the stairs to go down 2 guards at tables were checking bags etc. for water bottles. When he asked what flight and where we were going we weren't allowed through as ""you have to wait for the current flight to leave before you can go to the gate"". I'm not sure why but there was no way we were getting through. Once they packed up and left (20 minutes) we then went downstairs to the gate and waited for our flight. But it doesn't end there! There was a monitor above the departure gate but no details - then 30 minutes before our flight was due to leave 2 employees rolled up and placed the various flags and placards of their airline next to the gate - and these were of a different airline to ours. Upon enquiry as to our flight they had no idea (which was understandable as they are a different airline). Result - upstairs again and in a hurry to find which gate we were supposed to be at. We ended up locating where we had to be (gate 9) but there was no announcement; no details on any of the monitors to inform us that the gate had changed. Overall a shambles to be honest which leaves me thinking twice about returning."
"I've found a quiet time - 2pm on a Friday. Immigration was quick however on the second visit luggage took 45 minutes. Taxis are more organised but despite increasing the listed fares they still don't honour them (the board now says R70k to ""Kuta 2"" but they want R100k and even my Indonesian colleague couldn't get below R95k). And there's still a long walk from the booking booth (just before the gauntlet of shops at the exit - note that the only convenient ATM is opposite the booth) to where the taxis actually are."
Had a connecting flight in just two hours after landing and was a bit worried about the long immigration lines after reading some reviews here. All in all the whole experience with many queues i.e. visa on arrival - immigration - collecting luggage - check-in to the next flight - departure tax - immigration again took less than one hour. Most of the queues were short and fast. The only disappointment was that just transiting through the place cost me 56 USD - 35 USD for visa on arrival and 21 USD for departure tax (it is actually 200000 Rp but they use some crazy exchange rate if you want to pay in USD).
The airport is slowly growing with many more shops and gate lounges now in operation. The lounges need departure and arrival screens and PA systems. The departure gates are still constantly changing which needs to be rectified. The arrival situation is a disaster with a two hour period just standing waiting to get through immigration. We spent fifteen minutes total time in Melbourne airport upon our return. Denpasar is a disgrace as far as this goes. Departure from there is not that much better.
I went through this airport twice in the last two weeks both times I landed between 17.30 and 18.30 and left between 7.00 am and 11.00am. There was no waiting at visa on arrival or immigration and it took less then 10 mins to get to the baggage hall. The departure hall is a big improvement over the old terminals. All in all a good experience.
For a brand new airport terminal I was staggered to find out there are absolutely no drinking water fountains and the water in the toilets is not potable. So when you empty your water bottles at the security check point there is no way to refill your bottles before boarding your flight. This is a very handy scam for the shop owners who make a lot of money by selling bottled water. Why they built a new airport terminal without one drinking water fountain beggars belief. Unfortunately like all airports they are monopoly businesses set up to extract as much money as possible from people that must be rich enough to travel therefore no sympathy for them.
Fantastic modern Airport. On arrival progressed swiftly through immigration visa control and baggage checks my baggage already on carousel from landing to sitting in a Taxi it was just 30 minutes. Very friendly officials. Departure baggage and boarding very efficient you enter through very well sited duty free shops before entering the main lounge. Plenty of good hospitality available especially Last wave where you can get your last Bintang. The quality of the food is excellent and although slightly higher priced its well worth the money. Everything is easily accessible plenty of seating areas. Departure was on time and very smoothly run.
Arrival into Bali was a shocker. Day time arrival no air conditoning massive line up times. Paid entry fee in Australian dollars received change in rupiah and the receipt had to be requested and was given to us in US dollars. Whilst being held up in queues our bags were going round and round the carousal for hours. On the way to wait for the car many locals physically tried to take our bags from us and get us to use their transport. Our transport officer did not assist us with this. Departing - Officials taking peoples bags from them and making the traveller wait in line for check in whilst they take bags out of sight to check for drugs. From there to pay departure tax to customs to multiple gate stuff ups including not even labelling gates to a carryon bag search and pat down before being allowed in the gate. Once in the gate you couldn't leave and there was no water or food available for sale. Entry to the gate saw all water confiscated. Not enough seating at the gate with most travellers sitting or lying on the floor. When boarding the tarmac shuttle bus Virgin officials collected our passenger departure cards once shuttled to the tarmac there were no escorts at all or paths to the rear entry point of the plane so passengers were free to wonder around the tarmac.
I was at the new Denpasar airport last year and was impressed with how it looks. Great modern design but that's where it stops. They disregard the general common sense to make the airport experience good. Here's a few that I want to point out: 1) No baby room - at least a nappy table in a toilet would be sufficient. In this modern day and age I can't comprehend why they did not put this in while building the airport. So in a desperate attempt we had to look for quiet corner in the waiting lounge. 2) Travelator at the entrance is a hazard risk. A lot of people are just lazy in walking. So they stacked up their heavy baggage on a trolley and use it on the Travelator. What happened then is the trolley couldn't not exit the travelator due to its weight and it topples over. The travelator did not stop. They obviously did not think this through. 3) Air Conditioning fail. Upon entering the temperature is soaring especially in the afternoon where the sun blazes in through the side. Very uncomfortable. The AC wasn't able to handle this so we waited for many hours in the heat inside the airport. I had a very uncomfortable experience in this supposedly new airport. I am visiting the airport again next month and I hope they have addressed the issues. The only good thing about the airport are the cleaners.
Denpasar Airport. Compared to the situation when I passed through in July 2014 the new Denpasar Airport International terminal appeared to be at last nearly complete and functioning. The air bridges were now working. The business lounge was now open with computers wine and toilets available. It is small but very pleasant in design. The only drawback was they the played Balinese music quite loudly over the PA system which is not going to be to everyone's taste.
This airport is the worst I have ever been too. On arrival it is common for immigration waits of 2-3 hours. These queues are deliberate so that you pay the 'express fee' i.e. a bribe to avoid the queue. This airport is a disgrace. It has just been built but already there are not enough seats for outgoing passengers. The baggage claim can take forever because they are not big enough to take the bags from one whole flight.
Got off the plane at 12.20 pm and was met at the gate by a hotel representative and proceeded to go through VOA passport baggage claim customs luggage x-ray and then duty free and to are waiting vehicle in 29 minutes - amazing. On Departure left my hotel at 1.30 pm for a 4.05 pm flight. Got to the airport went through check in Departure tax security check and passport control and got to my gate in 25 minutes. This airport was by far easier than going / coming from LAX.
This was our first trip to Bali. Having read some awful reviews before our departure we went with a great deal of apprehension and limited expectations. I must say however that our experience - both arrival and departure - was excellent. When we arrived the total time taken from VOA through immigration baggage collection and customs to the waiting hotel car was just about 15-20 minutes. On our departure we left the hotel early (anticipating long queues and delays) to arrive at the airport some 3 hours before our scheduled departure. The time taken from the time we got out of the car until we reached the departure gates (baggage screening check-in airport tax immigration and security) took us all of 20 minutes or so. Throughout the process we encountered friendly and efficient staff. We thus had a lot of time to spend at the airport and we found the shops restaurants and facilities to be very good. On the whole we had an excellent experience.
We are on the way back From Jakarta to Sydney via Denpasar nearly got lost in the airport. No clear sign and no ground crew directing transit/connecting flight passenger from domestic to international airport. We have to find our way from domestic airport to international airport with very confusing direction/sign lucky we met with a group of touring driver on break which direct us to the more easy route instead of following the sign!
Just returned from our Bali family holiday. After having a good holiday our departure experience was beyond ridiculous. After boarding the shuttle bus to travel to our plane the bus stopped turned off the aircon leaving us waiting to get off. I guess that the flight staff were not ready. Eventually aircon turned back on only then for the driver to disembark us onto the tarmac to board our flight. Light rain was falling but okay given the temperature. What was not okay was a bus departing and the light rain turning to pouring down on us. We boarded our Virgin Australia flight soaked dripping wet and sitting in aircon for a five hour flight. We were offered paper towels to dry off. Nobody should have to board a flight in that condition.
I live in Bali part of the year and have to deal with this awful airport far too often. First the parking is small badly design the ramp access to upper floors is far too narrow making it too narrow to turn properly with a car. Inside the airport things are not much better. On departure Bali airport's has the most expensive taxes in all of Indonesia. Do you get a better service for that price? No. Arrival is a nightmare waiting times can be extremely long. After you eventually get out of the airport be prepared to face people who will follow and harass you to offer taxi services. If you want a taxi go to the official taxi counter there is an official price list with all major destinations on the island. Once you leave the airport you have to pay for the parking every time because DPS does not have a drop off area. If you want to drop off a friend with your car you have to take a ticket and to pay a one-hour parking fee. If you come with a motorbike be prepared to walk because the narrow and crowded motorbikes parking is located outside from the airport about 15mn walk from the terminals - very nice during the rainy season.
Our flight was scheduled for 3pm so we left to arrive at the airport at 12pm as many different sites mention long delays leaving. This obviously depends on the day I'm not sure but from arrival at the airport to stepping into the temporary lounge it was 21 minutes including the checking in 6 pieces of luggage through priority check-in. The airport is air conditioned - still crazy but better than the old one. The temporary lounge was mediocre but the drinks were cold the seats comfy and there was constant turning over of food but choice is limited. If you want other stuff wait for your flight or just head to any of the shops offering food. My biggest advice - check your gate. Ours changed without warning.
Just visited Bali after vowing never to return 3 years ago. Had read all the reviews about the new airport so was very anxious. We arrived at quarter to midnight on AFL grand final Friday night. We had purchased visas from very friendly staff were there were ample staff. Hopped into the lines for immigration and went oh no as the lines were massive. We were out the front of the airport meeting our friends half an hour later after finding lots of immigration desks open and very friendly staff. Our return was even more pleasant straight through check in and immigration. Plenty of wonderful places to Buy food shop sit etc. we certainly found that it was not an unpleasant airport experience by a long shot. Well done Bali on your upgrade.
Poor service dirty windows floors horrible toilets. That airport is the worst in that part of the world. And one of the most expensive. Sadly it's impossible to avoid this place. Not the best gateway to beautiful Bali. We waited 3 hours in the Q for a passport control after arrived. They should try put customers on the first place.
Flew into Denpasar early afternoon on Virgin from Brisbane. Almost no queues to pay for VOA but was confronted with a very lengthy snaking queue for immigration. We had 2 small children in a party of 5. At first the line was moving and it appeared we would clear immigration in approx 1.5 hours but that was before the immigration booth numbers were reduced to half. Don't know why but the immigration officers just walked off with even more flights having arrived after ours. About 30 minutes later extra immigration staff arrived and opened up some more booths. We cleared immigration in 2.15 hours and then collected our luggage which had been loaded off the carousel. Very tiring and stressful - not a great welcome to Bali. I had heard all the horror stories which sadly became true on this occasion. Our subsequent 4pm departure was an absolute breeze. Am returning in Jan 2015 so hopefully will have a better arrival experience.
Arrived midday on Thai from Bangkok and the airport was in utter chaos. The lines to immigration snaked around forever. Airport agents were offering to take people to the front of the line for 'only' $10! Otherwise we waited and waited while immigration officials came and went and waited and waited. It took 1.5 hours to get through immigration. A nightmare welcome to this otherwise dreamy island. Leaving the country was much more organized and much faster.
"Arrived on a Virgin flight Friday 5th September 2014 at around 3pm. Took 3 hours to get through the visa/customs debacle. Left on Monday 15th September 2014 and took 40 mins to check in go through all of the checks and find our departure gate which did change 3 times while we waited but thanks to these reviews we were prepared and just sat it out and listened to the announcements. Take plenty of rupiahs to the airport - food and coffee is very expensive. I bought two sandwiches and two mango smoothies and then did not have the $30.00! I don't know what the solution is to avoiding the busy periods on arrival - maybe travel agents have a heads up on ""good"" times to arrive and avoid the longest queue I have ever seen or been in in my life. Oh and my husband went off to see if he could ""pay"" for a faster entry and was told yes - $100 each to jump the queue which we declined more for fear of crowd rebellion than the exorbitant price."
"Read some of the other reports on the new airport in Bali and some of the reports are ridiculously inaccurate. We arrived 3.5 hours early and ready for battle only to find great signage impossible to get lost loads of food options at about 3-4 large cafe/restaurant/bars with ample seating sure they are at typical airport prices but comparable to any international airport in Aus/South Pacific pleasant temperature typically polite and friendly service staff. Yes they work at Balinese speed but don't forget you're on holiday! So get over it! So in terms of what to expect at the main entry there aren't really good food options other than snacks at a WH Smith you will go through one security screen (no queue for us) then check in. Pay your departure tax at 2 easily identified booths before customs/passport control. One more security screen (where now you do have to ditch your water) with your carry on and you're then into the main plaza where there are loads of shops (which are at eye watering prices after the kuta market!) and plenty of eating options. We are about to head to our gate now which is a 2 min walk) sure we may see another security screen but they're hardly an issue. Yes the arrival is a bit more tedious with massive room but only a handful of passport control people but with 3 flights arriving at once we still only had about an hour and we were through. Be mindful of the uniformed ""porters"" who will grab your bags in the baggage claim area unless you're ready to tip them and then we'd recommend head straight to the taxi booth where it took us about 5 mins to sort a cab at what is a reasonable price (or go and haggle with one of the multitude of freelance drivers who will try it on with the 1st 2nd and 3rd prices they offer you). Really can't see what the fuss is about."
Arrived at 3pm on 03-09 from Amsterdam via Hong Kong together with other flights from Australia. Queuing for a visa was quick but rather long for immigration- over an hour. The question is do we want all airports to be like Singapore-Changi? I definitely do not as this is what all travelling is about experiencing different cultures and circumstances. If you find this unacceptable than staying at home is an option as the queues are not going to move any faster.
After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took Due for a 2.45 arrival on a Thursday landing delayed as we had to sit in a holding pattern for over 30 mins. 1.5hr wait to get through immigration word is that you can't purchase the VIP pass anymore to get through quicker but you can go up to someone and pay then and there if they are in a good mood. I was already 4 lines into my wait when I found this out so didn't want to risk it. Flying business or having premium FF gets you nothing on arrival at this airport every foreigner queues together. On top of all of that took an hour to get to Seminyak. Departure was a completely different story. 20 min drive from same Seminyak location at 6pm on a Monday. Waited 5 mins at priority check in (here I was provided an entry card to the temporary lounge) around the same to pay the departure tax (yes it's annoying but most if not all other imports have this it's just built into the taxes when you book your flights!) then maybe 15 mins at immigration? In there there's also 2 security check points that had less than a 3 min wait. Decent sized duty free but pricey from what I saw (alcohol in Australian airports is cheaper). The temp lounge was packed could probably fit 100 or so people seated. Food selection consisted of sandwiches vegetables soups fried rice salads and some fruit. Refreshments include sodas water beer and wine as well as hot drinks. Severe lack of power points which seems to be a growing trend these days. I walked past 3 food outlets to get to the lounge but can't comment on the quality or selection. If is written this review based purely on arrival you'd see 1 star but I'll bump it up a bit because of my departure experience.
Just over the whole place I visit Bali at least 7 to 8 times a year and sometimes only for three days but having to spend so much wasted time at a dysfunctional airport both in and out that seems to be getting worse even through it cost more to enter and exit. Why is the departure tax cost not included in the ticket like most other airports? Then its up to the airline to hand over the fees instead of passengers waiting in yet another unnecessary line. Its amazing that this airport was officially opened in August 2013 yet its still under construction and still has no proper air line loungers only a poorly fitted out premier lounge with stale food and uncleaned seats with staff who mainly just stand around rather than looking after the lounge. So its seems that if you just clap your hands and smile all the problems will go way or at least this is how the airport management deal with things.
New airport is much worse than the old one. Much of it still seems unfinished with a confused and confusing layout. Few staff are apparent and the immigration staff are the rudest I have met. An officer with little grasp of English grilled my wife at the desk about wanting to work in Bali for no apparent reason at all. If this is the introduction to Bali it will put people off visiting. The exit is via duty free and on leaving you enter via duty free just to try to squeeze the last rupiah from your fingers. On departure the food is over priced garbage. All this and the increase to $35 in the arrival tax and 200000 rp departure tax - obviously not spent on the airport.
After reading all the reviews I was expecting the absolute worse. Landed on a Saturday evening and overall took about an hour from landing till getting out of the airport. VOA arrival took about 15 minutes and was easier than I remember. Now the immigration lines themselves were long and slow. With staff talking amongst themselves. That was the bottleneck. The advantage was my bag came out about 2 minutes after getting through immigration and through the x-rays 5 minutes later. Leaving was a different story (shocked at how quick it was). Arrived early took 10 minutes to check in the Departure tax line was 5 minutes and through the security checks and immigration 10 minutes after that. It's like 2 different airports. Inbound dirty and feels grimy. Departures was clean! Needs more seating though. Warning: Australia bound Flights go through a final security check at the gate (looking for liquids). This is not their fault this is an Australian Government Request and ran into this at every airport in the last 12 months (including Dubai).
Terrible huge queues on arrival it took us two hours to get through the airport almost as long as it took to fly here from WA! New airport is slower than the old one and the increase in airport tax must be lining someone's pocket because it's not put towards staff at the arrivals desk! 4 people trying to check in thousands and they didn't seem to be any hurry. Terrible start to a holiday.
We have travelled to Bali 4 times now as we love everything about this paradise - the culture the people the land and the lifestyle. However our recent trip was the first one through the new terminal. First impression was wow - this is huge and easy to navigate. Payment of the arrival visa of $35 US was quick and easy. Then we noticed the 'cattle grids' to get through immigration and the queue to get into the cattle grids this took us just under 2 hours. By the time we got to the luggage carousel many flights had landed after ours so our luggage was piled in a heap against the wall. Moving on another very lengthy queue of disillusioned passengers was waiting for us to scan everything on the way out. Fortunately our driver was patient enough to wait - 2.5 hours from plane to exit is beyond ridiculous. The way out was worse - Our flight departed at 12.20am. Our driver dropped us at the airport around 9.30pm we expected to check in find our gate and perhaps sit and read for an hour. Lengthy queues again - lost count of the security checks and how many times we had our luggage scrutinized paid the 200000 IRP exit visa negotiated our way through passport control to be affronted with what can only be described as a duty free shopping mall with the gates hidden behind more attempts to part you with what money you have left only to find our departure gate but no seating. After standing around for a while checked the departure screens to find that our flight had been moved to another gate at the opposite end of the (enormous) terminal. Arrived at the rescheduled gate to at least see a very welcome seating area queued up (again) to have our hand luggage checked (again) to find out that the departure gate was changed back to the original gate we were at with no seating! Apparently this gate is only a standing waiting area where you are crammed in like sardines to wait for your standing room only bus to take you out onto the tarmac to climb the steps to your plane. Ours was not the only flight leaving from this gate - 5 others were at the same time well when I say gate it was more like a bus terminal - without seating! So if you find that your flight is departing through gate 10 - prepare for a long wait on your feet! Needless to say we spent the 3 hours departing this terminal waiting in queues and walking from gate to gate when we were anticipating a lengthy relaxing read! Needless to say - we had a wonderful trip to only be tarnished by this airport - Initial thoughts from the front it looks absolutely amazing sky high vaulted ceilings beautifully decorated and planted but it just does not work.. With the exchange rate my partner and I spent almost $120.00 Au on getting in and out to experience what can only be described as a very poor one.
I agree that the new airport is worse than the old. Are the carpets really new or temporary. They are so so dirty. There are no facilities and the lounges are a disgrace. I cannot believe how bad it is. With all the money available for this project the situation beggars belief.
Terrible airport. Bali achieved quite a performance there. They have built a new airport which is even worse than the old one. Average waiting time to clear immigration and customs is between 1 to 1.5hr some unlucky passengers may even have to wait 2hrs. A complete disaster and a total shame.
Arrival was a disgraceful 2 hours to get through now having to pay $35 US for an entry visa per person and the queue for immigration was horrendous. Very bad start to holiday. Well to depart was 10 times worse new airport but where are the staff the scanning machines and down right customer service. You now pay 200000 rupiah for departure tax. The worst experience ever in Bali after 25 years of travel to Bali. People were missing their flights even though they arrived 3 hours before. The system here is shocking and we have now decided to never return to Bali. We pay a very high price to enter and leave this country so one would expect good efficient service. So chaotic be very prepared.
Bali is a wonderful island. Unfortunately the airport the gateway to the island is a disaster. Many of those that land in Bali have spent long hours in a plane and truly look forward to relax on this beautiful island. It can't be that you then have to queue for more than 1.5 hours first to pay for a so-called visa then to pass customs and then to remit a form in which you declare not having imported certain goods. This airport is a threat to Bali's economy and it is hard to understand why after so many bad reviews nothing seems to happen. We will not come back until this issue is solved.
A perfect introduction to all of the worst aspects of Bali. The new Bali airport is a shocker let's give credit where credit is due. It's clean has clean toilets and it's big and new that's it that's all that it currently has going for it. The worst things about the old Bali airport have moved across very comfortably to the new airport. Rude and arrogant immigration and customs officials. Deliberately lengthy immigration queues which always then have the option of paying extra to get through quickly. Ridiculously restrictive alcohol rules again so you can pay your way a round them. Endless hassling by porters. Then you end up in a beaten up taxi with a rude taxi driver charging you too much and taking too long. Basically an over priced rip off and a really ugly first impression of Indonesia and more sadly Bali. Whenever possible fly in through Jakarta.
Was looking forward to the new airport so much after a number of visits to the old terminal. What a disgrace: arrived 3pm on a Tuesday in July queued 2-3 hours for visa fee booth and passport control was exhausted after this not-so-happy start for a holiday. Poorly designed and poorly manned. Departure was slightly better but long queues again. The architects should have read Bali Times or Jakarta Post more carefully over the years both have duly reported the rapidly increasing number of flights to this great island. What a shame they got the new airport so wrong!
"100 countries visited and this is by far the worst airport if you take in what means they have available. Bali has a working tourist infrastructure people are friendly and they are able to build proper houses. Yet its airport experience shames the whole island when it comes to first and last impression. Arriving is hell. Departing is hell. On arrival there are queues to join the first queue. To pay for your arrival ""visa"". Its not a visa its just a fee. Then its the queue to the non-existent passport ""control"". But with thousands of people queuing for just a few open windows who can blame them for not checking anything but that you paid for your ""visa"". Even if you spent two hours queuing your luggage will not have arrived yet at the luggage hall. On leaving there will be more fees to pay and at least 7-8 checks before you are on the plane. Same things checked over and over again as if the other checks where manned by incompetent idiots. This Airport is best avoided. It you are coming from Asia/Europe it might be quicker to transfer to a domestic flight in Jakarta. At least you wont start and finish your vacation with resentment towards Bali."
The airport is still undergoing reconstruction. None of the air bridges were working in either old or new terminals. Domestic departures was through the old domestic arrivals area. Business lounges for both domestic and international flights were fenced off parts of the main concourses with no computers available. No alcohol was on display but I discovered that in the international lounge a waitress would bring you a glass of wine if you asked for one. Arriving from Australia was a dreadful experience because many flights arrive at the same time. There is no fast track. Travellers should note that you have to pay the visa charge a desk before immigration which is not immediately obvious. It took 35 mins just to get through passport control with further long queues for the customs scanner and to exit the car park. (I subsequently noticed that there was not a car park wait at other times of the day.)
Arrived early afternoon with carry-on luggage. Through new Bali airport in twenty minutes! Helpful pleasant staff. Returned to Australia on 9pm flight Friday and experienced similar scenario!
Very poor communication here. Staff were friendly but incredibly slow we almost missed a departing flight in spite of being there early. The departure gate had been changed but no announcement was made the incorrect gate was on the boarding pass and electronic screens. A final call was made for our flight a few minutes before departure resulting in a huge cue of confused passengers required to use the same gate as another flight to another city at the same time. Sealed water bottles sold to us were confiscated yet other passengers were able to take theirs through as most bags but not all were searched. Food and beverages were very expensive and service slow. I have been to airports all over the world and although modern and clean this one was very disorganised. Our arrival was just as frustrating with 2-3 hr queues through customs luggage dumped on the floor and poor communication to passengers.
Very different experiences arriving and departing. Arriving we encountered massive and slow moving immigration queues and the most unfriendly staff i can remember at any airport. Leaving the terminal you see how much of an effort they have made to make it look nice with thousands of plants cascading down the outside walls of the terminal which itself is quite contemporary and airy. On leaving Bali the experience was better with very friendly staff all the way through and pretty good facilities for an airport of its size.
I just wanted to give my review after leaving Denpasar this morning at 8.30. I was very nervous especially having read these reviews. Our arrival 3.5 weeks earlier was pretty much what everyone else has described. Sure there's lots of room for improvement. But it's always been that way. So this review and taking is really just in relation to our departure experience. This morning we had an 8.30 am flight. We were checked in paid our departure tax gone through immigration and were sitting down to a rather pricey coffee by about 6.45. So all very smooth sailing. The airport is clean no toilet queues all very nice. I realise this would be different at different times of the day. So we're sitting killing an hour and a half before we leave and at 8.10 we decide we should head to the departure gate. But on the way we hear them page my husband. We arrive at the gate and we're late! We're last on the plane. There was no announcement but this was probably our fault for not getting to the gate earlier. Anyway I just thought I'd give my POV as I know a lot of people (me included) rely on info from the www and we can get too caught up in all the bad stuff. But our experience this morning was a breeze.
When we arrived at the airport still part of the building was under construction lots of declaration forms first second declare prohibited items then long queue at the scanning point. I wish the white card and declaration of the prohibited items was together to make things easier. When returning to Singapore drinks were expensive limited chairs and make sure you have at least 200000 rupiah per person when returning for airport tax which is a joke as countries like Taiwan Hong Kong Singapore Seoul Bangkok already include this in the airfares. Immigration - only 2 counter open in the morning at 7am with at least 60 people queuing despite lots of immigration counters.
"Generally what can be expected from this sort of destination except for the overzealous security staff confiscating bottled water bought from within the departures area (duty free section) of the airport. I proceeded to drink the water and empty the bottle and was still refused to take the totally empty bottle on board! Pathetic. Ground staff and check-in persons are non-existent and nobody was around from Jetstar to talk to over the progress of our 3 hour delayed flight. The boards never updated and the first we knew we were leaving was an announcement of ""Last Call""! There was also one lady to happened to slip (badly) on the very polished marble floors when going out the transfer bus. There was a ground agent standing right next to her but she didn't even assist to get her up or even ask if she was ok. Again just totally bad service and surly people. Spoiled a great holiday."
Bali was my first overseas holiday people had warned me about the porters that try and grab your bags then want money for it and the guards that could apparently be bribed to get you through the queues quicker and so on. Well we landed in Bali at 10pm and had to walk onto the tarmac. The shuttle bus smelt and we were crammed like sardines all standing up. Three international flights landed at the same time so it was busy. Inside the queues moved quickly staff were rude. The woman that stamped my visa didn't even look at me. The man who x-rayed my luggage was too busy talking and didn't look at the screen at all. All in all it was okay not as bad as I expected. When we were departing from Bali: Late flight home again Jetstar like you to be at the airport a few hours early. There was nowhere for us to check in for a good 30 mins. None of the staff knew what was going on. Got through the rest quickly security were so rude! 20 mins before our flight was due to take off we still didn't have a boarding gate. The information screens were in Indonesian and not one staff member could speak English. Lucky we heard our flight call got to the gate where we were treated to a pat down and bag search before we finally got on our flight.
We landed in the New Denpasar Airport early afternoon. We were bus transported to the terminal we then proceeded through the Visa on arrival passports check etc... The process was absolutely hassle free fast efficient and friendly. Every counter was manned and the lines were only four-five deep so it took no time and we were out at the taxi booth paying a fixed price for a Taxi to our Villa in Seminyak (au $10.00). After reading many very disturbing reviews about the airport departure process we decided to get to the airport early. We went to the airport by taxi and arrived 3 hours before our 11.30pm flight. We have travelled extensively around the world and been to many international airports and Bali airport was one of our better experiences. The booking in immigration passport check luggage checks all worked well with very little delay. The food prices in the airport were more expensive than on the streets of Kuta but that is typical of any airport. The shopping section cannot be avoided the walkway winds through the shops this not unusual in airports. Once we got to the departure lounge I found a lot of congestion many people were sitting on the floor. We had not been allocated a departure gate and the flight details board did not have the departure gate numbers listed for many of the flights this caused congestion. We simply walked past all the congestion to another group of departure lounges (plenty of empty seats) and we waited for the announcement telling us which was our departure lounge. The announcements were loud and clear. There were many spotlessly clean toilet blocks throughout the departure lounges in the airport. I strongly recommend once you get to the departure lounge area walk to the left past the congestion and you will find many empty departure lounges and empty toilet blocks. We look forward to going back to Bali and seeing the airport when it is completely finished.
I travel to Bali every year and have done so for the past 15 years. Last year I went through the old airport and as I left in a taxi I saw the lovely new one next door thinking 'gee that looks nice pity it wasn't finished for this year'. This year I got to experience the fancy new one - how could they have got it so wrong. To be honest it wasn't too bad arriving but with multiple planes arriving at the same time it is confusing which carousel to collect your luggage from. We were lucky our bags came out first so we were then able to move to the next point - having them x-rayed for clearance. This is confusing as you need to go need to double back to put your bags through the machine before moving forward to the declaration inspectors. There wasn't signs telling you to do this and many people who collected their bags moved forward through the gate to the inspectors as you would expect to do but were yelled at by a security guard to go back to the x- ray machines. If these machines were at least on the way to the declaration station this would cause less chaos. Everyone is told by the airlines to get to the airport at least 2 hours before departure which in all the years I have travelled overseas to a variety of countries has made good sense. When departing from the Bali Airport arrive at least 3 hours early with your fingers crossed and a good book. On arrival you will be asked if you want your bags wrapped in plastic if you do then allow more time again. Most people I noticed didn't take up this option me included. When you make your way to the check in counter ASK someone which one as they put the wrong signs up. We were leaving on a Virgin flight @ 22.10 to Melbourne on flight VA54. The 3 check in desks displayed Brisbane 21.20 pm VA 58. After some confusion and wasting time looking for our flight I eventually asked 3 people including other passengers and was told the signs are wrong it's the Brisbane desk where the Melbourne flight is. Getting into line @ 7.30 it took until 845 to be processed. Initially there was 3 desks open but shortly after standing in line one was closed leaving only 2 desks to process both the Brisbane and Melbourne passengers. Now having received our boarding passes it indicated plane boarding time is @ 9.25 Gate 10. Next is the need to pay the Rp200000 departure tax at another counter which was done efficiently and quickly IF you had the right money. Next was the immigration centre where about 600 or more people had lined up waiting to be processed. Having waited over an hour in the last queue my heart sank stressing I had less than an hour to board my plane. Amazingly this process was quite quick as fortunately they had about 8 desks all processing people quickly. After passing through Immigration you can not avoid the Duty Free and every other hugely overpriced shop as to get to the departure gates you must wander or run in my case through all of these. I wanted to do some Duty free shopping but unfortunately this was no longer an option as my plane was now boarding. If you want to go to the toilet before boarding good luck it if you are female. There is only one sign for toilets and the line up was enormous. As I wanted to change into warmer clothes for the flight back and unable to get into the toilets I managed to change behind a pot plant! We were then ushered down stairs and loaded and packed onto buses like sardines and driven out to the plane where you walk up stairs . Having taken our seats we had to wait for 2 more bus loads of passengers before finally leaving late. Like others are saying it does spoil an otherwise lovely holiday. Such a shame but I don't think I'll come to Bali again as there are other tropical places to visit that have happier endings!
"Generally speaking my views are identical to Mr Powell's review below. There were no ""aero bridges"" available for both my arrival flight or my Departure flight. The arrivals hall wad enormous spacious. I had arranged the VIP service through Garuda Orient Holidays so it took around 5 minutes to have my visa in my Passport. When my flight arrived from Brisbane there were already 2-3 International flights that had arrived before mine so was a rather long queue ahead but all Immigration counters were open and fully manned so the queue moved at a steady pace. All luggage came out at the one carousel what a mess. I waited around 10 minutes for my suitcase I was then whisked away to yet another long queue to have all luggage X-rayed. This process over you exit the arrivals hall into the mass of people from Hotels/Tour companies and the like waiting for arriving passengers. The traffic is non stop out of the Airport. Now the Departure information: You are dropped off at a ramp where you can get a trolley for your bags it's a short walk up to the first Security check where your bags are X-rayed takes a couple of minutes. Then if you decide to have your luggage plastic wrapped there are around 4-5 stations where this can be done. The ""check in areas"" are spacious plenty of signage areas A-E and the entire area is spotlessly clean. There are no restaurants/Cafes in the Check in areas a huge mistake as there were many passengers in need of a cup of coffee. After check in there was ample seating in the Departure/Check in areas whilst waiting. After check in you walk the short distance where you pay the IDR 200000 Departure tax (A$20.00). The waiting tine at this point was only a couple of minutes. Then more Security screening separate lines for both men and women moved quickly. Then we have the shopping Duty Free and a lot of high end makes Designer and beautifully displayed very impressive. They are set out whereby all passengers must pass by every single shop. There are a few restaurants as you pass by the endless shopping a little expensive but convenient. The Gate areas are well laid out but the carpet is somewhat worn. The Boarding gates they cannot get it ""right"" too many passengers running all over the place with the constant changes. The worst gate being Gate 10 where the majority of Aussie bound flights depart from and as in my case my Garuda Indonesia flight to Brisbane was scheduled to also depart from this gate along with 4 other flights on Virgin Australia Jetstar bound for Perth Adelaide and Melbourne. It was total chaos. Headed down the escalator to yet another holding area where all passengers on the four flights were jammed in like sardines with airport staff screaming out the flights to a lot of confused people never seen anything like it in my 40 years of traveling. The airport may be lovely when first observed but the organization of the Departure/Gate areas require urgent attention. My holiday in Bali was just wonderful but with the airport debacle at the end put a sour taste to my Bali experience. Just for your information I arrived in Bali on Friday 7th March 2014 and departed on Friday 28th March 2014."
"They have spent a lot of money on ""upgrading"" Denpasar airport but IMO the overall effect has been to make it worse than the old airport. I have travelled to Bali many times and was quite familiar with the old airport so feel qualified to comment. Arrivals have gradually improved over the years. The VOA is much quicker than it used to be the immigration desk is generally quicker although bottlenecks and delays do occur from time to time. Sometimes the bags are off the carousel before you get to them but at other times there can be a short delay. Overall arrivals are OK. The Departures area looks impressive as you first enter. Signage is pretty good although the sign for our check-in desk was wrong. The Virgin check-in desk had only three people on duty and was handling flights to both Sydney and Melbourne at the same time causing delays. The departure tax desks are now very close to the check-in desks and are a huge improvement on the old desks upstairs. Security is segregated male/female causing some confusion as people queue in the wrong line. Then you come to the Immigration department and from this point onwards the new airport is a failure if not a disaster. Long queues at emigration control then down this channel of shops/duty free whose quality is poor yet whose prices are so much higher than the street prices in Bali. Food choice is very poor food and drink prices are over the top such as a can of soft drink being more than treble the price on the street. Then you come to the chaos of the waiting area. There are inadequate seats and passengers sit on the floor in great crowds blocking access to the gates etc. Even though its a new space it is grubby and shabby. Long queues for ladies toilets but not for mens toilets. Once the flight is called it is a mad rush to more queues at the departure gate and another security check which seems pointless since it is very cursory. I bought a bottle of water after passing the main security check and after checking with the vendor walked four paces to the second security check and had the water confiscated! Then its down the steps to a holding area and here it was crazy. A throng of people aiming for two different flights heading to the same door; staff members yelling/screaming trying to get some sense of order. Then on to the jam-packed little bus that takes you to the plane. Only after boarding the plane can you breathe easy once again. I absolutely love Bali but this departure mess is a sad way to end what otherwise was a great trip."
I arrived at DPS around noon last week. It literally took me 14 minutes from plane purchase of VOA immigration and customs. Granted we were the first flight that had arrived in about 45 minutes and I was in business class so I was the first one off the plane. However the entire system worked extremely well with friendly staff baggage waiting for me on the belt (10 minutes after landing) and a quick and easy customs. I had some friends that were forced to wait an hour or so because of arrival during a peak time but overall the new airport is beautiful and works very well for arrivals. I did not depart Bali from the airport so I cannot comment on departure.
"The New International Airport Arrivals - 4 star plus experience. Huge improvement on Old terminal. But International Departures dramatically worse than the old one. A very poor departing experience. Full of Low Cost Flyers having to wait hours lying all over the [dirty] carpets. Gate Management is chaos. Never like this in Old terminal [10x better]. Shopping ""snake alley"" - a bit too obvious forcing all departing pax to walk - and 95% nothing from Bali. Facilities - some toilets as good as any anywhere. Carpet - fine if it's going to be pulled and thrown out 31st March latest. Yes understand work is still in progress - but January [1 hour + to get in first checkpoint] and even late March 10 mins plus. Some real hard changes definitely needed and none difficult. The last view of Bali needs to be the lovely happy relaxed and lasting Balinese experience."
After reading bad reviews we were dreading our trip to Bali but were pleasantly surprised! After leaving Perth airport (a disgraceful small airport with non existent facilities) we arrived in Bali at 4.25pm along with 2 other flights. The visa on arrival desks were plentiful with smiling attendants. Then onto customs/immigration which were a bit slow but once again friendly officers. Our baggage was already on the carousel so we were out of the airport and into a taxi within 10 minutes.
My review will be less inflammatory than others because I have the good fortune to only ever use Bali airport at off-peak times. So I'll acknowledge that it's a massive improvement over the old terminal. There's more space and it's much more comfortable and attractive. There were still hints that despite spending a lot of money on a new terminal they still didn't cater to the existing demand (immigration took 20 minutes and there was a relative lack of seating airside otherwise things moved quickly). There are definitely still problems - hopefully some are temporary - that people should be aware of. Most flights are using buses at the moment and the terminal entrance where they drop you has 2 big steps and no wheelchair ramp - I saw 3 staff struggling to get a disabled guy up them. We didn't get arrival cards on the plane and there is very little in the immigration hall to tell you that you need one or where to get one (there were piles on some - but not all - of the VOA counters) plus there was one single desk in the entire cavernous hall where you could fill them out. Signage is not finished (or it's intended to be terrible) and it can be hard to see how to get from arrivals to departures (with a new terminal they really should have catered for airside connections) or where the taxi booth is. There are rigorous security checks before AND after check-in - the first one seems like an afterthought since there isn't enough room to do it smoothly. There are no ATMs in departures so if you forgot the R150000 departure tax (I had miscounted and I ended up R500 short!) it's back down to arrivals and then through security again. And what is the stupid serpentine gauntlet of shops that you have to run to get to the gates? I wonder where this horrible trend started - I know Sydney's done it for decades (but mainly in arrivals). All up a massive improvement over the old terminal in off-peak times.
Just had my first experience with the new airport. Still a few bugs to be ironed out but I think it's not so bad. On arrival we had to get bussed to the terminal we had pre arranged express visa but there wasn't really a line at immigration anyway. It's well worth it at peak times though. As usual priority business tags on bags were not first out. It also meant there was a short wait to have the bags screened upon exit. We were then shown to our car by the express visa girl which wasn't far and were away. After reading all the negative reviews about departure I was prepared for long lines. It wasn't too bad. First line to get into terminal to pass baggage screening was about 10 minutes. There was a long line at Virgin check in but was no one in business class line so I was straight through. The next line stop was departure tax with pretty much no wait at all. The customs line was the longest probably about 15 minutes. They have free wifi at the terminal so wasn't so bad. Two extra staff would have made this a breeze. Seems to be a few complaints about the shopping strip you have to walk through. There's all you usual duty free here at exorbitant airport prices. Made my way to the temporary lounge. The furnishings are very nice and comfortable the food selection is basically the same as the old lounge. Very limited and not high quality but pretty much standard for most of Asia. It was pretty much at capacity when I arrived and was annoyed that they were letting in people paying to enter. A couple of flights were called and it soon cleared out. The lounge wifi didn't work at all but the free wifi provided by the airport was great. On departure bags were once again scanned and the plane was on a sky bridge so boarding was quick and easy. Things are certainly not as bad as previous reviews have encountered. I did love the outdoor terrace garden at the old airport lounge hope they have a similar setup once the new business lounge is complete.
"I fly to Bali regularly. Wasn't a fan of the old airport inefficient gloomy shopping areas etc. I was hopeful seeing the new shiny airport. This cost a lot of money but is no improvement. Immigration queue ~2 hours with a ""VIP"" fast track for 25 USD. Gate shown barely 30 minutes before departure. Very little seating space. Poor cafe options with no appetizing food options and unappealing seating. Very long shopping mile which you have to walk through too few gates for number of departures. Very poor passenger management at gate. Two flights to Singapore were located at the same gate all passengers from both flights herded into the tiny gate area (no seating whatsoever) and staff tried to sort out by shouting. Staff were giving attitude to passengers who did not immediately understand the crazy sorting of passengers. Incompetent crazy passenger traffic management. Good points? The bookstore (Periplus) is fine and the toilets are reasonably clean."
Arrival okay just slow. Departure horrible. Queues long and they must try to employ the rudest staff they can find. Cash only for departure tax and yet no one thought to provide an ATM. Once through had lunch at the closest sit down cafe only to be served an awful club sandwich. No decent food places and nowhere else to sit. Bags opened by security many times and queues for everything. Worst international Airport available. If the staff were at all friendly it would at least make the lack of facilities bearable. Indonesia should be ashamed of this effort on such a beautiful place.
"I passed through the new Bali airport in November without any problems so some of the reviews below got me a little anxious for my January trip. Arrival at about 5pm wasn't too bad VoA payment was quick Immigration not as quick but there was a fair queuing system in place and it only took 20 minutes to clear. My departing flight was at 1am so I made sure to reach the airport by 10pm. Check-in departure tax and Immigration were all quick - I sympathise with the reviewer that clocked check-in at 20 mins per person but maybe some airlines are better than others. The compulsory walk through the shopping area seems to have got longer funny although signs in the airport say it is ""smoking and tobacco free"" I distinctly remember seeing a tobacco section in the duty free shop. After the shopping area things start to show signs of stress; too few toilets with queues spilling out VIP lounges just fenced-off departure lounges; not enough seating people all over the floor. There are a few food stalls which look pretty temporary but prices are close to western airport prices. Surprisingly there is free drinking water to be had but only a couple of dispensers and supplies were running low. No information counters and no PA speakers in the toilet. Clearly the new terminal isn't really ready yet but all this said my experience could have been a lot worse."
New airport looks similar to the old one just a bit bigger. Arrival was fine (after some past horrendous experiences we always opt for the express service). The real horror story was departure. Massive queues total chaos. I was timing how long it took them to check in each passenger and no joke the average time was 20 minutes! For each passenger! Flight departed 3 hours late. Flight crew were apologetic saying they were ready to go on time but the incompetents at check in couldn't do their job. Disgrace. Funny thing is departure was ok at the old terminal.
We are frequent visitors to Bali and the new terminal is a delight in comparison to the old for arrivals. The service is pretty much the same (slow) and the baggage collection is a worry (especially when 3 planes luggage all unloaded on to 1 carousel. After our first trip we learnt about VIP express - for me its worth the additional $25USD. Departing is a nightmare lined up like cattle to enter terminal once you get in the door there is limited seating. Our last trip had 4 planes leaving within 10 minutes of each other to Brisb Melb Perth all flights checked in a same time through 3 counters people everywhere - total chaos. The departure tax counter poorly signed. Once actually through the formalities things don't get any better minimal seating limited food and beverages available untidy PA garbled. All in all they have a way to go before it is world class.
Worst check-in experience ever. 45 minutes standing sweating in a line leading into the terminal to get bags scanned. Finally into air conditioned terminal but total chaos at Jetstar counter. Four flights leaving no direction to queues and another 1.5 hour wait. Only one person checking in the Perth flight. About 40 mins before the flight is due to leave someone finally comes out and asks if anyone is traveling to Perth. Yes says I us and the other 100 people standing in the line behind me. At last through to the next queue and a 20 minute wait in another line to pay departure tax before joining the next line to get through customs. My wife would have gone to the toilet but the flight was already being called and there was yes you guessed it another long queue to the ladies extending out into the waiting lounge. But there was time for one last pointless bag check and body check before we went through the boarding gate. The person in front of us was complaining that the experience was so bad he would never visit Bali again. This airport is a national embarrassment. After sitting on the plane for 20 minutes the pilot announced that the ground crew had disappeared he couldn't raise anyone and we weren't going anywhere. Turned out the baggage conveyer belt had broken down and the bags were being moved manually. Total fiasco.
We departed Denpasar on first day of new facility. The hotel transport delivered us to the wrong area. When we got to the departure gate the staff directed us to the right area. We were uncertain how to get there and enquired at the Garuda desk. They were very friendly and arranged for us to be taken to the correct gate by buggy for which we were very grateful. The new departure area was large cool clean and I loved the clock. The staff were being abused especially as there was no duty free shopping by some of the travellers and I found it very embarrassing as it was their first day in the facility. All the staff were doing their best.
Bali tourism is bound to suffer as a result of the operational fiasco in the new airport. It took my family over 1.5 hours to get through security customs etc and to the departure gate. There are separate security screening points for males and females so I was separated from my sons - is this a religious thing? The queues were ridiculous with less than half the staff required at the checkpoints making the waiting endless. When we got to the departure gate there were people sitting on the floor and around 100 seats cordoned off - the staff had no reason for this. If travel time to and from Bali is going to continue taking hours longer than necessary tourists will start to go elsewhere.
"We flew into Bali on 26 December. We didn't have any real problems with VOA Immigration and Baggage collection. No doubt we were the only flight in at that time. On the way out of Bali - 2nd January it was another story. The first security screening was grossly inadequate. The queues were massive and as there appeared to be only 2 x-ray points it took forever. I pity the poor tourists in front of us who waited for approx. 45 minutes in the queue to be told they were in the international departures area not domestic. No signage of course. Once through the first security screening it was another long wait to check in. Purchase of the departure tax was quick but the next queue through immigration was very long and slow. There were more people collecting the departure tax than there were checking at immigration! The fact that we are now forced to walk through an enormous duty free ""hall"" is annoying. Whilst it appears most airports are doing this it would be nice to bypass them. There are no restaurants just a couple of cafes with a couple of tables each and a couple of ""hot dog stands"". There is little seating and plenty of people were sitting on the floor. You can't go to your departure gate to sit down because you don't know which one you are allocated to until it is announced. Once at the departure gate the duty free purchases were wheeled in on a flat bed trolley!!! We had to get on buses to board the plane. The first two buses delivered passengers and then didn't reappear with new passengers for an hour. The airport is not finished is not staffed sufficiently or correctly and the services are non existent. The whole airport experience was horrific. Next time I go to Bali I will pay someone to express us in and out."
We arrived in the New Airport in September and it was chaos. Not enough staff and it took 2 hrs to get through immigration. Just back from another trip in Dec/Jan 2014 and this time in the Arrival and Departure Lounge chaos. Arriving a worker was haggling for money and he would get you straight through. We didn't accept but 2 hrs later wished I had slipped him a few dollars to take me through. Saw about 10 people being escorted through by this guy. Will be looking for him next time. No staff again. Departing we got there 3.5 hrs earlier because we wanted to look around the new airport and have a relaxing meal/drink if possible but no. We got to the gate 35 mins before boarding and no meal yet. My husband is diabetic so that was a problem but got some snacks quickly before we boarded. To book in there was a huge throng of people all en masse and as you got closer to the booking in of baggage the masses parted and tried to choose the correct lane for their particular flight. People were arriving and just going to the front of the queue and we witnessed a couple of fierce arguments from frazzled travellers. Then even if they were in the right queue they were crossing over to the first vacant line. Bedlam. Again only one staff for each planeload. The plane was delayed 45 mins due to travellers still trying to get processed. Very poor organisation.
Waited 1.5 hours to get into the airport through security screening. Moving walkway had no emergency stop and passengers were injured as there was no room at the top to step off. No staff managing people. Food outlets very poor. No seating available and not enough seating throughout the airport. Hundreds of passenger sitting on the floor. Business lounge disgusting. Dirty floor and chairs. Little food. No utensils. No glasses. Few drinks in the fridges yet few people in the lounge. Not possible to get luggage from car-park to departures as ditches and high kerbs prevent you get luggage across the roads. Poor signage and no staff managing the queues. Quality of finishes in a new airport the worst I have seen in a long time. No wonder tourist numbers are dropping off in Bali. Unacceptable airport and its new.
I travel a lot for business and pleasure and have got used to the peculiarities of airports in countries with little experience of how to run one. However Bali seems to have gone into reverse. The old airport was cramped and a bit lacking in facilities but at least it wasn't hard to navigate. The new airport has clearly been opened long before it was ready but even that cannot make up for the staggering and embarrassing disaster that they now have in place. The other posts have covered most of the points (no food no seats nothing working etc) so I won't labour them again but just to say that I have been though airports in third world African countries that were better. The only bright spot was the Balinese themselves who are unfailing polite and smiley. However this was such a bad experience it would be a factor in deciding whether I visit Bali or one of the many other destinations in the region next time.
Airport upgrading still ongoing. If you arrive during mid-day the chances are you will have eight back-to-back flights with 2000 passengers arriving between 11.30 to 1.00 pm in DPS. We paid for VIP Arrival Service which means we were whisked away passed the extremely long queue at immigration to the luggage collection point. Yes the luggage took some time to arrive but the immigration queue was much worse. The airport lacks seating facilities the Premium Lounge was a make-shift sitting area bordered by temporary partitions and there was no facility for kids. Truly an airport that tests your patience.
Avoid this airport at all costs if you can. Transit through this airport should also be avoided unless you want to stand around for hours with very limited seating and very limited facilities. You have been warned!
What a disgrace. We arrived at the new terminal and it has none of the charm and grace of the island. The VOA process is fast but the immigration queue was the worst of any airport I have ever seen (and I have visited some bad airports) it took us about 2 hours to get through. Over half the immigration counters were not staffed and there appeared to be no supervision. There is apparently an express service that allows people to jump the queue I have never seen such a thing.
We touched down at 1530 and there was another international flight that had just landed. Visa on Arrival process is very quick there are 12 agents serving and so it doesn't take long at all. However it does mean that anybody on the plane who doesn't need a VOA gets to join the immigration queue ahead. We arrived at the queue and were faced with around 400 people ahead of us. I estimated the waiting time to be around 60 mins minimum. There were 8 immigration agents working but a little slowly. I asked a separate agent who was directing passengers for 'Express Service' and bargained him down to USD 45 for the three of us. Took 5 mins to clear immigration (he took us to a separate queue counter) and pick up our bags. No hassle out of the airport in 15 minutes. Just remember if you don't want a particular service be polite and firm. They all respect that - no umms uhs buts etc. Get straight to the point and don't waiver. Otherwise in Bali as they say everything can be 'arranged'. PS - This was my first trip with our young son who was a bit hungry and ill and I needed to exit the airport quickly.
The newly constructed airport terminal at Bali is a disgrace. There is minimal seating so persons are forced to resort to the floor. The disembarkation arrangements are pure farce. I arrive on Garuda ex Tokyo in the evening. It was raining heavily as the movable walkways do not seem to be operational passengers had to walk across the tarmac there were 8 umbrellas available for a full A330-300. Designers have used polished stone in outside areas not a good idea in the tropics. Travelators are not installed at floor level but rather require a ramp up and down. The queues to get into the airport are just as bad as with the old airport.
Arrived from Singapore with Qatar Airways and into the new terminal. Seemed to be the only flight around so was quickly through the VOA and immigration but despite the lack of other flights baggage took an eternity to arrive. Departure was an absolute joke. Huge queues to even get into the terminal and the first security check. Then check in. Then another queue for a further security check then departure tax and a final queue for immigration. Limited staff on departure tax and immigration. Then the biggest frustration is that there's almost nothing in the way of facilities or restaurants available. The so called business class lounge was very poor. Quite clearly the airport just isn't finished yet. Why they didn't wait I just don't know. Overall a poor experience and worse than the old airport if I'm honest.
"With the opening of the new terminal I was interested too see if there was an improvement on the old terminal. Sad to say no brand new building but the with no improvement in customer service. On departure we where herded through to the old terminal which looked like it had been stripped of anything useful. Stifling hot with 3 flights crowded into the same area. When I arrived back I was disheartened to see approx 400 people in front of me waiting for a visa. There seemed to be more people asking you for express service (fee) than manning the immigration desks. Along with the hundreds of others spent a few hours queuing to get in. Then there was the question ""where's my luggage"" so of course you walk from belt to belt to find your luggage. Welcome to the land of smiles."
Arrived and departed from new International Airport. We arrived on 7 October during APEC and were required to catch a bus to walk 10 metres as we didn't exit via air-bridge which was surprising as we flew Garuda. Quick transition through immigration but it took over 40 minutes for the bags to arrive. We were the only flight arriving during this period. Another scan was required and took another 30 minutes. Very disorganised. For departure from Bali the Airport is in utter chaos! If the airport isn't finished don't open it as the old terminal worked just fine. Confusing setup currently with security before check in departure tax counter another security check and then finally immigration. This is where the buck stops! Nothing completed! No food options and my guess is the airport is only 50% completed. Absolute disgrace to call this place a airport. Hang your head in shame! Keep the old terminal open until the new one is finished. Probably the worst airport in the world at present.
Flew from Brisbane AU. It was still organized chaos. Arrived in Bali at 2.30pm which was one of their busiest times and were delayed in the air for an hour. Transferred to the terminal by bus. Buying the Visa on Arrival (US25 each) went fairly quickly but the wait to get through Immigration took much longer. Airport is quite humid and hot with no air-conditioning. There was a delay in getting our luggage took an hour and no signage so confusion as to which conveyer belt was ours. Immigration staff were ok and friendly to our son. Lots of touts trying to take your bags etc but just watch your bags and give a firm no. The pick up area was crazy but we found our pre-paid taxi fairly quickly. Leaving Bali there is a quite a long walk from drop off to the entrance and luggage touts are everywhere. We couldn't find any carts nearby so I gave in and paid a tout 30000 Rph ($3) to carry our bags (for 5 people) to the entrance. Had to wait a while to get past the first security checkpoint which was a pain and a bit stressful. Arrived a little early for check-in (9pm) and had to wait 15 minutes. We then paid our exit fee (150000 Rph / $15) and got through Immigration after about an hour. warm. Airside I had thought we could enter the best of 3 lounges (Premier Lounge) but was told by as we were not affiliated with their partner airlines. So we went to the cheaper one on the other side (Marigold Lounge) but it was only 150000 Rph ($15). Facilities were ok seats reasonably comfortable food choice was a bit limited (rice noodles sandwiches cakes and pastries and coffee free beer but what do you expect - its only $15). Lighting was a bit dark for me. Large flat screen TV to keep you entertained. Free WIFI. Toilets / showers are located at the back outside the lounge and were basic. We spent about 1-2 hours there. Staff were friendly. We had to go through a final security check just before the gates. Limited seating at the boarding gate so we stood around for about 30-40 mins before getting onto our flight. So our experience at Bali Airport wasn't too bad overall just need to be aware of the chaotic environment.
Arrived at Bali late afternoon with Malaysia Airlines. Had arranged VIP service so arrival experience was great. Walk straight through the immigration. However if you are not arriving at the peak hours save your money. The queue wasn't too bad at all. I was also surprised how fast they deliver luggage to the belt. The meeting points for pick up was chaotic. I have never seen an airport so busy. Even if you stay at a 5* hotel you might have difficulty in locating your driver. Traffic leaving the airport was bad but that was part of the Bali experience – chaotic order. Leaving the airport was a bit easier. Took a midday flight and it wasn't the peak period at DPS. Before proceed to the check in area we were asked to show our ticket. I was bit amused since nowadays who would have a paper ticket? Luckily they just wanted to confirm that I was actually a passenger so my iphone calendar with flight number confirmed that. Luggage drop was easy no queue and was handled by a very friendly lady. The departure hall was larger than I expected with a lot of shops. Most of them overpriced but that’s the same in all airports in the world. Terminal building is very dark and not interesting so I went straight to the lounge.
The check-in area for international on the ground level is fine but when you get to the departure area through immigration that's where things go bad. Seating is very poor and rather than create areas with windows the airport management have given priority to making it a giant shopping mall full of overpriced goods and people in the walkways continually hassling you for massage services. There are very few seats in the airport despite many empty seats in the numerous eating outlets. If you want to watch the aircraft coming and going you have to go to the gate lounge but you're not allowed into this area until shortly before your flight departs. The cleanliness of the airport is satisfactory and staff are friendly. One other negative thing about the airport is that it is about a 300-500m walk once out of the terminal to the start of the car park. Unfortunately for those of you travelling to Bali - this is the only airport option. On the positive side - there is the selection of a new airport building and a couple of cranes so hopefully in the next 3 - 10 years this will be completed with adequate windows and runway viewing areas.
I really like this airport it really is Bali in a nutshell. I read people complaining about porters and immigration officers who let you walk past the line for $25 extra. Those people have to understand that that is just how Bali and frankly Indonesia in general is. Westerners don't usually understand the approach of these porters they can seem intimidating. In the end it's of course money that makes the world go round but a part of them is genuinely trying to be helpful.
The domestic terminal of this airport is in desperate need of serious upgrades. The waiting areas are overcrowded with seats that are not well maintained. The check in area looks very unappealing. Also the check in staff need to tell passengers to ensure that they pay airport tax as there is no clear signage about it. I had to go back to pay the airport tax before I could proceed airside.
"What a badly designed badly run and expensive place to travel through! US$25 per traveller coming into Bali and $15 in Rupiah going out. The drop off/pick up points are a couple of hundred yards from the international terminal. This means you have to run the gauntlet of greedy porters and it also means trouble for anyone with less than perfect physical fitness. Strangely there seem to be pick up lanes just outside the terminal which have been closed off and disguised with large pot plants. Coming into Bali airside you are presented with a line of men in casual clothes who will short cut the immigration line (and also allow you to bypass the mandatory fingerprinting of visitors) if you pay them an extra fee. Then it's a case of fighting through the porters and the mystery of locating the pick up point to leave the campus. Leaving Bali there is the security check as you enter the terminal (not sure why) followed by heaps of expensive shops and several so-called business class lounges which in fact are just lounges which bargain against each other to try and get you to pay enter and use their services. You'll be generally badgered by retailers and lounge staff as you move through. However where staff are genuinely needed at the second set of security checks before the gates you'll find a paucity with the predictable enormously long lines. I arrived 3 hours before my flight and despite doing no shopping or ""lounging"" I only just boarded my plane in time. The second security check had 3 staff checking hand baggage and passengers for 3 flights. Then another ""open your bag"" security check at the gate itself. Denpasar is a horrible airport set out to extract the maximum amount of cash from unwary travellers and it can at times feel threatening. I've never been through such a bad experience when travelling. I couldn't come up with a similarly bad airport."
Arrived by Garuda who have really lifted their game. However organised chaos would be a good description. Earlier comments re porters is true airport authorities need to take a more proactive attitude and not be complacent. Departures information boards are sketchy there is practically no public seating so I stood and walked around for 2 hours. Went out to a plane in a bus during pouring rain.
Clearly not designed for the numbers of people it handles. However I was there in low season and I think staff at least make a good attempt at moving people through efficiently. The biggest problem is the huge distance from the terminal to drop-off points with touts all along the way. Also the prices in the airport are the same as western airports (despite Bali being otherwise very cheap).
A total circus at the airport immigration wait was not too bad although very unfriendly at the Visa Section. The Porters are a total joke! We ended up with 5 Porters holding onto our two bags and all demanding copious amounts of US dollars for handling them. We found the Porters intimidating to say the least! Completing the checking in process took an age so my advice would be to leave sufficient time prior to boarding.
Make sure to use the toilets on the plane the next toilets will be before immigration but that could leave you even further towards the end of the queue. It will be hot in the immigration hall and there are no seats. The entry visa of US$25 can be paid in rupiah. Would always recommend to get transfers organized by the hotel not an external company. Departing from Denpasar get there in time as immigration can again take quite a while. Sitting in the final waiting area before departure can get confusing as there are only printed paper signs with your flight number stuck up. Wait outside the boarding gate until the flight has been called a few times.
I got to experience both transfer and local arrival and departure. Arrival was fine. I had read horror stories about Visa on Arrival procedure especially with several flights arriving around midnight but process was smooth and fast. Everything is clearly marked pay for Visa process immigration then exit through customs. All desks were open and took 10 minutes. Transferring to domestic flight had to walk outside to domestic terminal. Domestic terminal is a bit haggard and worn with struggling aircon but well labelled and efficient. Must have Rupiah to pay departure tax. Lots of Taxi touts on exit but just refuse and proceed to taxi desk where rates are preset. Departing from international terminal was smooth but all the shops burning incense inside makes the air quite acrid and there is no place to sit until about a half hour prior to departure when you are finally allowed inside your gate area.
Flew into Bali December 2011 with Virgin arriving on time at 2.30pm. As I expected this to be a busy time in customs and immigration and being a senior lady I'd prepaid $25 to be met by concierge services at the entrance to the arrival hall. Transfer from the plane to the hall was by bus. I was in the second bus and on arrival no Bali Concierge representative to be found and no one holding up my name. I walked around enquiring about the company and looking for assistance but no one knew this company and no help was in sight. I bought my own visa continued through immigration on my own collected my own luggage and passed through customs. This probably took only 30 minutes so wasn't particularly busy and I was very lucky. The following day I SMS'd the Bali Concierge services who requested what my arrival flight details were assured me they were at the airport from 11am to 11pm and if I'd like to use them for departure it would cost me another IRP125000. Needless to say I did not use the company again and have put this down to another of the Bali scams. So be warned obviously hoping to make the entry to Bali easy doesn't always work.
Arrived Sunday lunchtime. Very humid. Lines are ridiculously long at immigration on arrival it took us 45 minutes to clear. Once through the baggage carousal is not clear you need to ask what carousal your luggage is coming off. Once you walk out of the airport there are no signs for shuttle buses to hotels nor is there a taxi bay. Trying to get information from the information desk is like talking to a brick wall. Unpleasant experience.
As a frequent traveller to Bali I have got to know it reasonably well and the key to the experience is when you arrive and depart. If you are fortunate enough to arrive from Kuala Lumpur at lunchtime you will have a much better experience than if you arrive in the afternoon when there is a rush of large planes. Same as when you depart. The midnight flights back to Australia are usually packed so expect long delays when you are departing. The queuing for visas and then the queuing for immigration make this one of the worst airports in South East Asia. There is the corrupt VIP service which allows you to skip the lines if you pay an extra $25 each and families often fork out this to avoid hour long delays in non air-conditioned space. There is no duty free on arrival either and as other reviewers have mentioned beware of the porters. The shops when you are leaving though are excellent.
An openly hostile attitude greets travellers at both immigration and customs but my gripe is that the transit lounge has been closed which means that travellers are forced to purchase a temporary visa (US$25) irrespective as to whether their connecting flight departs in five minutes or five days.
Arrived about 18.30 for our flight to Darwin and had a meal in the main lounge area. The meal was good both my wife and I remained at the cafe for 2 hrs and then moved to the boarding lounge had no problems passing through immigration or any of the security posts. When the boarding call was made for this flight we moved through the check-in down the passage way to the last security post this is where it started to go wrong. A young man on the security check told us we were on the wrong flight during this time he became quite animated using a loud voice. It had now been announced final call and we were still having trouble he maintained that this was wrong and would not listen to us to resolve this I waived an older officer over to sort things out and all was cleared in a matter of minutes.
Depending on arrival time the place can be smooth to get through or backed up for a good hour. Porters are pushy and always around to carry your bag for a fee. Be careful to book your taxi at the counter just outside the greeter area. The airport is sorely in need of renovations. Only two toilets at either end of the terminal shops full of junk smoking allowed in cafes and no wifi. Better hope you have lounge access.
Arrived late after midnight. Visa on arrival + Immigration took at least 1 hour. Bags had been removed from the carousel by relentless porters. They'll grab your bag before you have a chance to get to it. They shouldn't be allowed inside the customs area- we weren't sure if they were legit airport staff. Had one follow us through customs and direct us to money changer (not great rates). We ditched him without tip because we didn't really want him following us anyway. Taxi queue outside was very long and slow moving. Suggest you arrange a transfer in advance.
Pleasantly surprised - both incoming and outgoing - no real hassles crowds or delays - just follow the signs. Arrival to pick up approx 30mins drop off to duty free shopping approx 25 mins. That was in March 2011. Can't say the same about Melbourne arrivals - 1hr 30mins!
Didn't really like the atmosphere around the airport. It was way to crowded and unorganised. There was a very long queue when I had to pay the airport tax and could hardly find anywhere to sit.
I was prepared for the worst when I arrived at Bali airport after reading all those terrible reviews. I was arriving on Malaysia Airlines from KL and our flight was delayed for 1 hour. Maybe that was the reason that there was nobody queuing at immigration and we were outside within 20 minutes after arriving. Immigration and customs took no more than 5 minutes as my passport allows for a visa free entrance to Indonesia. Once you leave customs there is a long row of money changers but don't be a fool and change money there. The rates in town are much better. Our arrival was very efficient and I could not fault it except the long walk from our gate to immigration which took about 5-10 minutes as gate 2 is at the far end. Departure was not as good as you already have to pass through security just to enter the building. Check-in was ok and took a while even though we were already checked in online. Paying the exit tax was pretty straight forward and involved no queuing. Once pass immigration there are a few shops but the prices are not competitive if you compare it to other Asian airports in the region. The airport is old but I have seen worse. You pass through security again at your gate and once inside there is nothing much so do not bother going to early. Boarding was civilized but the infrastructure is really outdated. The gate agents set up a microphone and stereo set to announce the boarding calls as the gate did not have a speaker system. I found I was probably very lucky to have this smooth experience in Bali.
While expensive I recommend using an arrival concierge service. The mid-afternoon is particularly brutal as multiple widebodies arrive within a few minutes of each other. We arrived took our time walking then met by our agent. He took passports and visa fee then escorted us past immigration to where we waited for luggage. Around the time it came off he appeared with our passports. So we're talking 15 minutes top which we killed hitting the ATM and bathrooms. He then helped us to the front of the final xray queue then past the hawkers and helped us locate our driver. $30 per person but worth it.
Horrible experience waited 1 hour at immigration. On top of that they take 25USD visa fee from you to come into the country and 15USD tax to leave the country. Therefore you get an old ugly airport and chaotic surroundings. For me such kind of handling is unacceptable in a popular tourist destination and we will never go there again and spend our money somewhere else like in Thailand or Malaysia.
Arrived 17th July absolute chaos. We waited 3 hours in the stuffy immigration hall. At one point an immigration officer waved goodbye to us and left his post - he was not replaced. It appears the whole system is totally overwhelmed - what a welcome to Bali.
On arrival horrifying lines at immigration. More than one hour we stood in line and hall was totally overloaded. Baggage was already taken off the carousel and you have to search very good to find your baggage. Outside the airport some money-hunters take your luggage to carry out for a lot of money. Beware! On departure again paying tax. No lines at customs. Inside a lot of shops but expensive if you compare it with Bali itself. This airport needs a huge facelift and some new ways to manage the incoming passengers.
The Airport in peak season is a shocker. We had a 2 hour wait to get through immigration and only half of the counters were manned. Being pinged USD$25 on arrival and with two small children who were tired and extremely hot - it was an appalling start to the holiday. Due to the massive delay our bags were left unattended on the floor - lucky they were locked. Departure was even worse with some people being charged USD$20 departure tax and one family got ripped for USD$25 per person. For such an established tourism destination I give it a score of 1 out of 10 for the airport. I recommend Phuket anyday - far cheaper on all accounts. Bali Airport Management need to stop lining their pockets.
Not very impressed at all. Expensive entry visa USD25 then a 45 minute queue to move 10 metres. Non airconditioned immigration hall so everyone standing there in queues sweating. Fingerprint machine not going nor was the screening camera so no security scanning of incoming passengers. Hassled by porters trying to grab my case from me to wheel it all of 30 metres to the exit. On leaving exit tax of 150000 rupiah would be better if it were included in the ticket price. Another 45 minute queue this time to pass immigration. Only saving grace is the lounge upstairs which has nice friendly staff and a good range of refreshments. Overall not a great welcoming image for a tourist Island.
Arriving at 1:15pm it took us 2 hours and 5 minutes to move about 25 metres in the Immigration queue. Each person was being photographed and fingerprinted and it was taking 3-5 minutes per person so if there were 30 people in front of you. By the time we got to the baggage it was all there and had been sitting around waiting for us! At customs we tried to declare some dog food we were bringing in (for donation to BAWA) but he wasn't interested and waved us through. We spoke later with some other people who said the fingerprinting had only just been introduced. Not sure if this is correct or not but they clearly didn't have the hang of it. On departure go through security and give up your water bottle. Checkin was quick as there was no queue (Jetstar to Perth). Then another security check. Then we thought we'd buy a bottle of water for the flight (USD1) - figured as we had already given up our water and been through 2 security checks this would be OK. Another security check to get to the gate and they made us give up our newly purchased water. Lots of people in the queue had the same problem. What a waste of money and plastic bottles!
The Prada Lounge was the best way to enjoy the horrible waiting time at the airport. The staff were friendly courteous and the food and drinks were very enjoyable. I would recommend this lounge as an alternative to sitting in the main area although you will pay for it. Depending on how much you eat and drink as to whether you get your money's worth.
Arrival very frustrating long queues very slow through immigration. Over 3 hours just waiting and wasting valuable holiday time. Hope they can improve service soon. Cannot see why they are understaffed and so slow. Departure from this airport slow so many people at the top of the escalator no room to go. Not as bad as the arrivals though.
Denpasar - seemed like a brand new terminal (international) - sailed through check in - no longer than 5 mins straight to passport control - no queue paid my 15000 departure tax then into a superbly clean departure area. Many shops and eateries (bit pricey though) - although all outlets charged different amounts for same things. Went to one outlet that wanted 40000 rupiah for a bintang beer another on same aisle with better seating only charged 25000 - it pays to compare). Amusing to see in the gents toilets above urinals a fish tank with tropical fish - novel idea !
Checking in at Denpasar was chaotic. There seem to be all sorts of so called security checks without sufficient staff and proper facilities. We were travelling Business Class and had access to the Prada Lounge - a joke. The seats are falling apart and dirty there was very little food which was cold and unappetising. There were no clean cups and saucers for about 20 minutes. Outside on the lead up causeway was a man carrying a sign advertising access to the lounge for 100000 Rupiah. Where is the advantage in paying extra for so called business class comfort. If we didn't like Bali so much it would be off my travel agenda just because of Denpasar Airport.
"Arrivals are a nightmare with long lines and the requirement to purchase a visapresent passport and have visa checked. Once through this are pick up baggage (slow) and then walk into a sea of signs and drivers. Not the best experience but through in around an hour at 10.30 on a Sunday night. Departure was much smoother although multiple security checks and searches were interesting. Check in (star class jetstar) was quick as was customs. JAS Business lounge was excellent but boarding aircraft required another two security checks (one x-ray and one by ""Qantas"" security doing bag searches and pat downs. Overall the airport has improved considerably (5 years since my last visit) and in comparison to some other airports I would rate it fair. Note: duty free and shops remain expensive."
This airport is dreadful. Security is chaotic immigration takes forever to get through and is understaffed the meeting area for hotel car drivers is too small and crowded and the business class lounge is similarly awful. And what is really infuriating is that they charge 150000 Rupiah to depart. I make annual trips to Bali and I ask myself where does the money go?. A necessary evil I guess.
Dreadfully long wait on arrival at Denpasar airport. It was pandemonium with many flights arriving on a Friday afternoon and only 4 immigration counters open. Waited in the queues for over two and a half hours - hot and uncomfortable with young children and the elderly particularly suffering. Needs crowd control to organise the traffic of the public as people forgot their manners and queue etiquette went out the window in the stifling conditions. Not good enough considering the enormous amount of tourists providing Bali with an economy. However departure was a much smoother process.
"This is addressing the passenger pickup. I have flown in and out of DIA hundreds of times and yet on Sunday, 7/13/15 at 6.30 pm the ""traffic cop"" was clearly out of line and making it impossible for passengers to actually be picked up. She would not allow the cars to stop. This was so absurd I nearly laughed but became furious when she made my daughter drive around once and then again almost a second time because I wasn't actually in the lane of traffic. I know there is not waiting and now parking but there is absolutely no excuse why a car can't actually stop to load the passengers and their luggage. These rules need to be re-addressed."
The United area for smaller planes was Third world concrete block with swarms of people. We taxied for what seemed like 5 miles. Why is everything so far apart? Why is the Denver airport nowhere near Denver. Even the main terminal was a small bump on the horizon from the area we were in. I will avoid DIA at all costs in the future.
I have essentially 2 complaints about this airport. First I can't find an electrical outlet that is not being used. The place is packed with people huddled around electrical outlets. When this place was built people didn't generally walk around with cell phones and laptops - but now they do! This place needs far more charging stations. Finding a socket shouldn't be like going on a treasure hunt. NY JFK has them attached to the waiting chairs at the gates. Now we know Denver is no JFK but all they have to do is add more sockets to the wiring that's already in place. Second the food choices here are worse than those in the GA State Fair. I took two bites of my chicken burrito how can you mess up a chicken burrito? I totally disagree with those complaints about signage - this place is easy to manoeuvre around.
"Our experience at this airport was very poor. Incredibly slow TSA screening line caused my entire family to miss our flight wait five hours and pay $375 to reschedule. Despite there being maybe 200 people in front of us (two wraps of line) the process took half an hour! Multiple TSA employees appeared to be standing around while only a single screening line operated. Nobody from TSA seemed to have the slightest concern that they were taking far too long and people were at risk of missing their flights. Is there any motivation or reward for TSA employee efficiency? We made the mistake of flying with Frontier airlines. These guys closed the boarding doors 10 minutes prior to departure (we checked our luggage at their counter nearly an hour before departure and that got on the plane just fine). And then happily got $375 to reschedule. As with the TSA what motivation do these people have to actually help passengers? Zero! There are very few power outlets in the terminal (A gates) to plug in phones / laptops. With so many people sitting around (stranded?) it would be nice to have more power outlets! To be fair if you do not have to go through TSA screening and avoid Frontier airlines Denver maybe isn't ""too"" bad."
This is an unprofessional airport. With severe delays on August 9 the airport was an absolute disaster. I have never seen the likes. I will not fly here again.
My biggest complaint with this airport is that the layout was confusing for me on my first arrival in terms of figuring out how to leave the airport and get to the exit I needed to be at. There weren't many maps available to help me navigate so I essentially followed the herd and ended up at the wrong exit even though my pick up was able to find me later on. Amenities are OK. Bathrooms are pretty crowded all the time but it's also a busy airport. Waiting areas were pretty standard.
Denver airport has flights departing all through the night but amazingly there are no facilities open for their numerous red-eye travellers. Lounges shut at 2100 hours leaving you nowhere to rest or work after that time - apart from the airport floor. Surely extended hours would bring in business and provide more local employment? The airport is vast. It took about 3 hours to get from the gate wait for the train wait for bags wait for bus to the car hire lot travel to the distant lot and pick up our car. Combined with the airports location (on the wrong side of Denver) and the huge traffic jams on I-70 it's impossible to spend much of a weekend break skiing in Colorado.
I came to Denver on a visit from Philadelphia and expected the same disaster as I did getting here. I would have been dead wrong. Check-in was at about 8.30am finished getting through security at about 9.05. I was shocked. There were easily 300 people in the waiting line and we never stopped moving once. 4 machines working to process people the TSA staff seemed to enjoy their work and were very courteous with their clients. The gates seemed a bit far away but that's to be expected with an airport this big. The restaurants and bars in the terminal were modern and looked clean and well taken care of. The bathrooms were pristine and well stocked. Overall the only thing I found bad about this airport was that one of the electrical outlets didn't work. I'll gladly use it again.
I would rate their handicap accessibility as the worst in the USA. I fly fairly often from Midway in Chicago and there is no comparison. Chicago Midway transports wheelchair customers directly to their terminal. Transporting wheelchair people to a cart then waiting on a cement seat for sometimes half an hour is very uncomfortable. I was given a seat on the cart placed on very end without any handle and was trying to hold on to the side of cart as it sped along. To make this trip worse I was driven and left about a block from my terminal and had to walk the rest of the way. Wheelchair staff were rude. I will soon be forced to make this trip to DIA and am dreading it.
We flew from Denver to Indianapolis then La Guardia back to Denver during our motorcycling holiday in America. We found Denver Airport very easy to find our way around spacious and sparking clean and modern. I like the concept of catching a train to our gate rather than those walking escalators most airports seem to have. Plenty of eateries as we had a 5 hour wait. I forgot that I had two mini keyring/penknives in my cabin bag that I had bought at Yellowstone NP which of course showed up at security but security staff were very nice about it and showed me how to post them back to Australia.
I want to commend DIA Lost and Found department for getting my bag back to me after I stupidly left it at a hotel shuttle bus pickup island. Within hours they had called the number on my bag to let me know that they had it and after a few emails were able to FedEx the bag back to me. Everyone was so kind and helpful.
"I've been flying out of here for 14 years. Anyone saying this airport is hard to navigate is sorely mistaken. How hard is it to follow signs and move between 1 terminal and 3 linear concourses? Even gates on one side odd on the other. There is a healthy amount of people but not too many. Look at website to find restaurants. Security can sometimes be a hassle but look at the website and follow the signs to the less crowded checkpoint. Tip: there is a checkpoint at the end of the bridge to Concourse A. If you don't mind a little walk it is often much faster. To the person who took a wheelchair to gate ""E15"": while I have complete sympathy for your plight with the attendant I must point out that there is in fact no gate E15 at DEN. There has in fact never been a single E gate. US Airways does use gates B15/17 in the Star Alliance B concourse and they are quite far from the train stop. However other gates are farther and the moving walkways significantly reduce this travel for most."
It's 9.45pm on a Friday evening I just landed with a 2 hour layover and every restaurant and bar in the place is closed. There was McDonalds which is what I did - and it just closed. The place is crawling with passengers people everywhere and the airport has allowed all food vendors to close. It's absurd.
Denver is one of the most well organized airports I've ever been to. Extremely clean and organized. Even though there is heavy construction the airport is still smooth to pass through. Check in areas are easy to navigate and security is better run that any other airport in the US. The train is frequent but one good thing is the pedestrian bridge to Concourse A. You can fly to anywhere in the US from Denver but you're limited to mainly United Airlines because UA has a large hub there. Being one of the busiest airports in the US it feels emptier than it is and it's well run with all the chaos that major airports have. Having flown into Denver from both London on British Airways and Frankfurt on Lufthansa customs and immigration are very easy and quick to pass.
Easy Airport to get around very clean and the security line was only about 6 mins. D.I.A. Always seems to have their act together.
The airport is continuing to go down hill. Same long TSA queues lack of shops and bars and now the mayor has decided to phase out smoking bars hence many smokers have to stand outside and the smoking bar on concourse A is normally full to capacity. Yet another short sighted move. I think it shows why airports need to be in the private sector as they are elsewhere.
My flights in and out of DIA were later at night (10.30 and 12.20am) so the airport wasn't busy. Pickup and drop off by a family member was quick and easy. It was clean people were friendly and some shops and restaurants were open although it was late. In concourse A the security area is open but I didn't mind. I can imagine the lines get quite long as it is a small area. There could have been a larger seating area at the gate. The intercoms for the other gates can be heard throughout the adjoining gates which led to some confusion. Overall it was comfortable and pleasant.
Do not like traveling through Denver Airport. First time and had to rent a car. Pickup was no problem but drop off we almost froze to death waiting to get on the shuttle to take us to the terminal area the driver stopped at the rental stop which meant we had to cross 4 lanes of traffic/buses to actually access the terminal. Fortunately we did not have any check in baggage only carry on. Thank goodness there was not a snow storm while we waited for the shuttle. The rentals need to build a waiting area for customers. Security was dreadful. It felt like an open air arena for spectators to watch us all disrobe not to mention watch us all put our wallets and purses and technology on open display for anyone on the overhead walk way to make note off. The security area was in the middle of the airport lobby taped off so the wandering spectators did not walk through! In all my travels security areas are completely separated from public view and access unless one is flying. Come on Denver you can do better than this.
The TSA lines are absolutely ridiculous here. Flew Delta twice in past month both times it took 1.5 hours in early am from Homewood Suites to drop off Hertz Car suffer through the Delta Sky Priority ticketing desk and make it through security. Be advised that the Premium lane at TSA moves at 1/3 the speed of the general lanes.
Every time I fly into to DEN the gate of my connecting flight has been changed at the last minute. That would be workable but the flight status monitors do not reflect the change never! I am curious to why DEN needs to make more gate changes than other airports. The issue of the monitors not being up to date has been a long-standing issue with many many airport. Wonder why that is the case.
I fly through DEN every other week. I know this airport very well. My main complaint with DEN is that it has the worst Internet and phone coverage of any major airport I know of. It is hard to get a phone connection and then hold it for more than a few minutes. The free Internet provided by Boingo is so slow that it is pretty much useless. If you are a business traveler and have any scheduled layover where you will need connectivity plan ahead.
DIA continues to slide. I've flown out of this airport for 15+ years and it doesn't get any better. Queues are longer waits for baggage are longer it's crowded and it seems like an unusually large number of flights are delayed. Getting through security can be a nightmare. I'd rather fly through Charles de Gaulle and that's saying something. I'm also shocked at how rude the officials are at passport control. Overall this used to be a very good airport and now it's one of the worst in the US.
"First time flying out of Denver yesterday. So much airport construction added confusion and roundabout delays to a long drive from town. Flying US Airways printed boarding pass at kiosk and requested wheelchair was soon there (I'm 81 a lifelong flyer but that altitude got me). I had 55 minutes to make it thru security and to the gate. You'd think that was enough time. The man assigned to take me via wheelchair was the most casual person I've ever seen. He strolled so slowly from one end of the enormous terminal past all the shops and eateries to the gate via terminals corridors elevators trains and my gate E15 was the last one naturally. Actually feared missing my plane while my aide sleepwalked along. At E terminal gates are numbered down from 37 to 15. Finally at the gate and the gate agent said ""You just made it."" I was a wreck from trying to get the w/c attendant to speed it up to normal walking speed at least! Gave him a $5 tip anyway but they closed the door after me! Hope I never have to fly in or out of Denver again. There's too much sprawl with no geographical features to hem it in. Never had time to note those murals or to get any food before takeoff though we left Denver at 8 am for a 10.20 domestic flight. Wish I'd had an idea of the vastness of the terminal from check-in to gate. Would have left two hours earlier to enjoy the amenities. A wheelchair is a definite requirement there for an older person though I'm in very good health except for a recently-torn ACL."
Once you are actually in the airport it's lovely. Getting to the airport however is not nearly as pleasant. Flew in and out of Denver in June 2012. On the return from the time we arrived at the rental car return lot it took 45 minutes to get to the gate and the security line was just a couple of minutes. The car rental lots are a long bus ride from the terminal and if you are returning to Terminal West there's now a detour. If you don't need to check in take a bus to Terminal East if you can. Car rental prices at DIA are much higher than in Denver and the taxes are fees are very high - about 25%. If you can pick up your rental car downtown - admittedly not very practical with the transit options to downtown you can save a lot of money. I'm sure the airport works well for connections - but watch out for thunderstorm delays in summer - but for actually visiting Denver it's not very convenient.
I fly in and out of Denver a few times per year. Security times aren't the fastest but much faster than many other Airports. Check in is very fast and the terminal is easy to navigate. Many restaurants have lots of people but the service is fast so you don't have to wait long. Shops in the concourses aren't very crowded. The airport is built for a higher capacity than it serves so waiting for other planes doesn't take very long. Travel Tip: There are TWO security lines in the main terminal plus an extra in concourse A. The concourse A security can be used no matter which concourse you are flying out of. So just pick the shortest line.
I fly through DEN 3-5 times a year always though B Concourse. While there is a sense of spaciousness because of the high ceilings it is crowded always crowded - thronged would be a better word. The airport sits on a windswept mesa miles from any real services. Woe betide you if you face a spate of cancelled flights in the winter! The place is pleasant enough with a variety of middle of the road food choices but the new smoking lounge in the centre of Concourse B and the DEN Boingo implementation are two real black marks. No smoking lounge can never be made not to smell and when patrons come out the door they carry a powerful cigarette/cigar odour down the corridor with them. As for Boingo when you open a browser on a smartphone Boingo comes up as your only option and though it isn't free it's not obvious how to get past it to search through your cellular device alone. The only way I could find to deal with it was to turn off wireless services. DEN has a much better physical plant than PHX for instance but is nowhere near as traveller- friendly.
I use DIA at least once a month and for a major airport it is a disappointment. For those who travel often you will understand that this an airport that does not cater to you. The so called free wi-fi is unable to perform the simplest tasks and most of the restaurant/bars are so over crowded that you better not be in a hurry. Some are worse than others but I won't mention any names. Fix the wi-fi or at least give me an alternative.
Nice big well laid out airport. Flew in this past week and deplaning was easy no trouble getting into terminal friendly folks to point the way. Return arrived early security took maybe 15-20 minutes tops. TSA were actually pretty friendly. Plenty of shops tram is quick and efficient folks at gate friendly. Only complain is the rental cars are not at the terminal. You have to take a bus about a 10 minute ride out to the car agencies which means you have to account for this upon returning. Better than the other major gateways of NYC and LAX for sure.
The choice of restaurants and shops and the overall cleanliness of the airport was pretty impressive. Even the airport transportation from Pikes Peak parking area to the airport was well co-ordinated with reasonable waiting times. The only drawback is the security line however security staff are pleasant and respectful unlike many other airports.
After checking my bags at the curb I was unable to obtain a boarding pass. I had to wait to check-in at the gate. I have an artificial hip which usually causes me to set off the old style scanners. After an inefficient wait to have my items scanned I requested to go through the new x-ray machines. I was told no. I was told that it was because I didn't have someone to watch my belongings. I was forced to set off the detector alarms and submit myself to a pat-down in front of hundreds of people. It is a shame that Denver airport leaves such a bad impression in what would have been a pleasant journey. To top it all off since I was detained for so long at security and didn't get my boarding pass at the curb I had to sit at the back of the plane in the middle.
There is one huge problem with this airport. It is very easy to walk out of the security area without meaning to. I used to live in Denver so when I was scheduled to transit through DIA enroute from Atlanta to Sacramento I decided that I would have dinner at a restaurant in the main terminal that I used to eat at. When I lived there the upper level in the main terminal was part of the secure area - now it isn't. I came out in the main terminal and realized that I was outside the security area. It took me 45 mins to get back inside the security area. Fortunately I made my connecting flight. Needless to say I didn't have dinner. I bet this happens all the time - airport management should put up some signs - lots of other airports do.
I have used DEN 3 times and every time it has been a pleasant experience. Signage has been no problem throughout the terminal and I have always been able to find my way without any problems. The terminal has spacious concourses and it seems to be able to handle the considerable passenger load better than most airports of its size and traffic volume. Some of the carpeting in the terminal is getting a bit faded but the upkeep is very good overall. The security personnel had serious but professional manners and the lines were reasonably short. The distance to downtown Denver is a bit long but not unreasonable (many cities have longer distances).
Arrived from Dulles. Has three terminals (A B C) and they are connected by a train which is very quick. You could probably get from A to C in 5 minutes on this train although I don't know how often they arrive. TSA security line was very long and slow moving although you can sign up to an express security scheme there for an annual fee so this may be worthwhile for people who frequently go through DEN. After arriving you need to take the train to baggage claim which can be a tedious journey to go to the other side of the airport just to collect your bags. Sign posting for this is not immediately apparent to someone new to the airport. Ground transportation to downtown is plentiful but taxis are expensive ($65). Best to get the $20 airport shuttle bus which your hotel can arrange and which you can pay in cash. ATMs everywhere but they appear not to take Maestro cards so be warned. Distance from downtown is quite far and a car or taxi takes just under 40 minutes early in the morning and possibly longer later in day with traffic. Huge selection of excellent cafes restaurants and souvenir stores. Also has small number of internet PC stations so you wont need a wi-fi enabled laptop to get online here. Helpful friendly staff.
I fly in and out of Denver and it is one of the airports that you can figure your way around and also allows you to be able to find things you might have not expected. With the allowance to walk to terminal A and go through security there if you dont want to deal with the bigger security lines to keeping everything in check and also clean as can be it makes it such a nice place to travel through just wish the luggage would have been a little faster.
There are no hotels you can walk to from the terminal. Everything is located at maximum distance from everything else - rental cars accommodations and shopping. High speed rail to Union Station doesn't exist. If forced to stay overnight while changing planes vast amounts of time are involved getting to/from your hotel. I cannot conceive what the planners had in mind to create such an isolated ill-suited and tedious facility. Denver is a beautiful city but it is a distant glow from the terminal windows.
Transited twice in a week and found it to be a pleasant experience. Lots of folks but also lots of facilities for handling them. The space is comfortable and the layout is well able to deal with the volume. Nice place for a wait.
"I've flown into and out of Denver several times. Since we live overseas we always arrive at Denver after at least 30 hours of traveling and late at night. However Denver is one of a few airports that I land at after a long trip and do not feel like I'm cramped stressed or outdated. The terminals are very large and spacious and allow a large amount of natural light to illuminate the area. Even during the height of the holiday season when there are hoards of people flocking to Denver the airport gives the sense that it is never really crowded. Even the train system is rarely jammed with people. Despite that the problem that always seems to hit me is that my bag is always delayed or lost. After traveling for 30+ hours the last thing you want to do is wait for your bag or even worse be told that it will be delivered the following day. My suggestion is that Denver needs to find a real solution to their baggage problems. The ""new"" system has been a complete failure and United will no longer be using it because of maintenance costs."
As a long term resident of the Denver metro area I appreciated the location of the previous Stapleton International Airport for passenger convenience (excellent bus connections for example) and layout (you could walk to any gate relatively quickly) but recognized the value of relocating and improving the runway situation for operations. DIA's downsides are its location vulnerability of passenger and crew access during snow or ice storms (which sometimes close the access road and regularly make it hazardous) security (Hint: there is a generally less used security post to Concourse A that I use even when flying from a different concourse - access over the direct access bridge past the changing art exhibit is very pleasant - then transfer to another concourse if needed) and lack of a walking or people- mover alternative to the trains in accessing Concourses B and C as is available in ATL for example. Somewhat better direct international connectivity would be nice. DIA's upsides are its architecture relative spaciousness airport art the very pleasant bridge and changing art exhibition space between the terminal and Concourse A (leading to that third less- utilized though smaller security checkpoint) runway design passenger-handling capacity (except for extreme travelling periods) and a couple of food and beverage outlets. The personal greeting by Denver's mayor as you arrive in the train at the terminal is a nice touch.
A very nice airport in many respects. Internet access is poor. Abysmal free Internet service is erratic and won't permit sending SMTP email. They should allow pay services in addition. This is a big problem for business users and I haven't been able to find where to complain to. (Quest and then Skyport used to provide free LAN connections for business users but the space has been abandoned [Terminal B upstairs]. Nearest motels are 15 minutes away. The airport is supposedly the second largest (52 sq miles) but the amount of wasted space is truly extraordinary.
We had some time on a stopover and thought it might be nice to show our sin the terminal building which is a great and impressive building. To our surprise we had left the secure area simply by staying on the train to the terminal -- there is no indication that you have done so. We also felt that the scrutiny was severe. Liquids that were allowed through at our airport of origin were confiscated at Denver. We were lucky that the lines were not too long.
I've been through DIA many times and it's a pretty good airport. One of the best for the US. There are a lot of shops in and outside the secure area. Baggage is fast. Customs is fast. Security isn't always fast but it's never ungodly slow. Moving around the airport is pretty painless too. Personnel at ticket counters are professional and curteous. All the staff around the airport are generally pretty helpful. The only bad thing about DIA is that it's a hub for United. So if you go through DIA on an international flight or connecting to international you're probably stuck with United and that's no fun.
I fly in and out of DIA regularly. For the most part it is quite a pleasant airport not terribly crowded pretty efficient. Long security lines are possible especially coming from places like Mexico City. Hold onto your bags! I put my baggage 10 feet in front of me and a porter took it from in front of my eyes. He thought they were someone else's bags. By the time I caught up with him he had loaded the bags into a limo which then drove away. I tried for weeks to get the baggage back (it contained my passport wallet $1000 in photo equipment warm jacket house keys laptop cell phone - everything you never want stolen) but nobody was able to help me get it back. There are some dishonest people milling about. Please be aware of that no matter how tired or safe you feel at DIA.
Security goes fast and so does baggage claim. Excellent terminal for connections. I would use them again shame they dont have connections with Tocumen PTY Airport. The architecture looks beautiful.
Spent a total of 6 hours in UA's terminal during two separate transit stops. plenty to keep you occupied. shops are varied as are the food outlets. seating is plentiful rest rooms are clean gates are large enough to cope with full flights and departure info readily available throughout. staff are obliging. My airport of choice for transfers.
Been through this airport a few times over the last 5-10 years
Check-in is generally quick and efficient. Security wait times can build up especially at the two main security check-points. Overall TSA staff courteous. The inter-terminal tram comes every three minutes. DIA has a huge variety of gift shops book stores restaurants and coffee houses though the restaurants do tend to be kind of generic. If you are planning on connecting from an international flight to a domestic flight I would recommend keeping at least a two-hour gap as customs in Denver can be a little slow but you should be able to get out in about an hour. Domestic arrival into Denver is easy as baggage generally comes quickly RTD skyride buses get you into the city for about $10. Thankfully due to the recent surge by Southwest DIA isn't dominated by United Airlines but flying out of Denver is still a little more expensive than other US airports. The architecture is stunning and the airport looks new despite being nearly 13 years old! The only negatives at this airport are the location the security lines and the alluring loneliness of the airport due to its large size.
Main problems at DEN are security waits at peak hours (often 30 minutes or more since they funnel everybody through two checkpoints which are often understaffed) the large distances between terminals and the distance from the city itself. The positives are the relatively friendly staff good express bus service to the city center available right outside the terminal doors free WiFi in the terminals and ability to withstand winter weather (I've flown through three times during light/moderate snow and no problems with delays). I wouldn't want to try and make a connecting flight here especially if there's less than 90 minutes between flights but it's an OK airport if you're starting and ending your trip there.
People are friendly and real. That's customer service! The facilities are great and customs is an easy thing to do. There's a lot of walk involved but that I can say it's not a negative point. I'd add closer places to eat at Terminal A. Other than that loved the experience and would enjoy visiting this airport again.
This airport was clearly designed and built right before the security changes after 9/11. All the good restaurants are on the wrong side of security and therefore deserted while the small food stands in the concourses are over crowded. The wait/line at security is monumental and there needs to be an alternative to using the train to get to your concourse such as the pedestrian tunnel at Hartsfield. Forcing everyone onto the sardine can train is not fair. I realize airports are not something one would want to live next to but the location is crazy. Easily any hour's commute from south Denver combined with the rigors of the over-inflated airport itself can add hours to a trip that once in the air may be shorter than your wait at security.
"For its size a very good airport especially if transiting. A bit less if starting or ending there as security lines and baggage are a bit problematic. Security lines variable often quick sometimes maddeningly long and understaffed. They are making some progress: for example having people who will guide you across to the ""other"" screening if one is less crowded (DEN has two main screening lines with their entrances at the far ends of the very large main building so it is difficult to quickly decide which one to use. There is a third smaller screening across the bridge to Concourse A). Baggage claim can be a wait and seems to be getting worse. Baggage claim also seems needlessly cramped: for example all Frontier baggage is on three carousels (Frontier is Denver's 2nd largest carrier) so they are perpetually crowded (the signage often showing more than one page worth of flights coming on each carousel) when other carousels are empty."
A functional airport. Check-in efficient and security waits generally less than 10 minutes. Concourse A is the closest and the walk across the bridge provides a stunning view of the airport. Most of the staff friendly. Customs/immigration process has been improved and I was out in less than 45 minutes after my flight from London Heathrow. Be prepared to walk a lot at Denver because the airport is so spread out - my guess is that you'll probably walked at least a mile by the time you reach your gate.
I've been through Denver dozens of times and find it on the whole to be one of the best airports in the US. Despite its size it's easy to get around and I've found airport staff to always be helpful. As the airport grows in passenger volume I wish that they had more-frequent trains between terminals and that shuttle services could drop passengers off at check-in level but those are my only complaints about what is otherwise a good airport to use.
I use it fairly frequently and find it simple and spacious with stunning architecture to boot. Never have had a problem with long security wait lines - generally shorter than other major US airports. If you have to go to concourse B or C it is annoying to have to use the train and customs is sometimes woefully understaffed but aside from that I think Denver is one of the best airports in the US.
Flew in and out a few days ago. International arrivals/immigration has been expanded since I last flew in but still took at least 40 minutes to get through. What was frustrating was that it then took about half an hour for bags to arrive so all in all well over an hour to get out and this from Concourse A which is the nearest and smallest. Flying out a different story. No queues at all at the BA check in and no more than 10 minutes delay at security and less than 5 minutes for the fingerprint test. Generally this is a clean and spacious airport - easy to get around and with splendid architecture.
Flew into Denver during the second blizzard managed to land ok but waited 1hr 30 mins for luggage to arrive and had to catch a train to the luggage belts. Not a great first impression for an Australian and luckily an Indian man who lived in Denver showed me where to go otherwise I was lost. Used the airport 3 more times in the next 12 days and found it ok. Probably the best in the US but very average by world standards still. Some of the homeland security people were very nice and some very very rude. United check in staff uneducated and impossible to deal with and the police out the front were shocking! Then the car hire people didn't know the difference between a 4wd and a front wheel assist.
Transited through Denver concourse B twice in 3 weeks. Always a pleasure to use this airport. Procedures ran smoothly and staff are always helpful. Plenty of places to pick up a quick snack a reasonable meal or a coffee. Gate change announcements are clear and departure/arrival info is readily available. Gate lounges are comfortable and spacious. Luckily I missed out on the blizzard induced 3 day shutdown.
I fly through DIA every few month and find the airport to be one the best in the country. No matter which airline you fly on the check-in is always fast and efficient. Security can be a bit of a pain as it takes a long time but everything else is ok. The automated train reaches the concourses quickly and all concourses have a nice selection of restaurants and book stores. Even the immigration process goes by quickly. Upon arrival from Frankfurt I was greeted by a friendly customs agent and retrived my baggage with in an hour of my arrival. The only problem with the airport is the long taxi times and the bumpy departures and arrivals. Overall DIA is a very modern and pleasant airport.
I fly frequently through DIA for work and to visit family. Arrivals and connections are painless (other than the 30 minute drive back to the city for arrivals) but Departures are awful. Security is combined for all three terminals and the lines are badly managed - expect to spend up to an extra two hours on very busy travel days or an hour on normal days waiting for security. Other than the security lines everything is fast efficient and friendly - even the food leaves nothing to complain about.
Transited thru Denver three times in a few weeks. Always a pleasure to do so at this airport. Staff are friendly and efficient navigation and terminal transfer are easy flight info is readily available gate lounges are comfortable food concessions are acceptable and there is plenty to keep one occupied on a longer layover.
Great Airport - used it for a Ryanair flight to Stansted. Small highly efficient - great bar restaurant and shops. A breeze to get through - am going to use again. Wish they were all like this.
Fantastic airport brilliant staff took great care of my family when they were returning home and the baby travelling with them took ill. They couldn't of done enough getting medical help ringing emergency services getting flights rearranged with Ryanair free if charge. They also rang to see how the baby was on several occasions and when they were finally travelling home again the staff were yet again brilliant. You wouldn't get it in other airports.
Small airport which has about 3 flights a day in and out. But it has everything you need bar coffee/snacks bar and 2 small shops selling snacks and another selling perfumes tourist items. Given the only flights are Ryanair the staff are lovely trying to help passengers on their journey. Check in was painless and quick. Security checks again quick but thorough. So if travelling to Londonderry/Derry I would recommend.
This airport is very unprofessional. At 6 am I got in line to check my baggage in. There were 5 people in front of me and an inept crew behind the counter not helping anyone. There were two kiosks and one was out of order. The woman trying to use the only working kiosk took forever. After about 20 minutes one of the slack-jawed employees finally asked if he could help anyone. Well of course he could! 20 minutes ago. The impersonal level of the employees here was shocking and the airport was hot and stuffy.
For international departure DTW is ideal. For international arrivals DTW is to be avoided at all cost. The gross incompetence of TSA and US Customs at DTW amazes me. It took me almost two hours to slug through security and customs at DTW after arriving on time on a scheduled flight. DTW personnel (of which there are many but poorly trained) seemed taken by surprise by the arrival of my flight. TSA lines were needlessly long due to severe understaffing. DTW and TSA seem to have conspired to hire many employees to shout instructions to arriving passengers to cram into inadequate screening lines rather than to provide more screening lines. Avoid arriving at DTW from an international airport at all costs: TSA + DTW = totally inadequate to the point of utter incompetence. Delta and KLM: this is a major hub for your international operations. Why do you routinely subject your unfortunate customers to such mistreatment at DTW?
This is a very convenient clean and well-designed airport. It works well both for international as well as domestic travel. There are numerous transportation options to and from the airport and the tram in the McNamara terminal is very convenient. Security is always very efficient yet thorough. I have been running late a number of times for flights our of Detroit Metro but the ease of parking the efficiency of security and the tram have always got me to the gate on time. Additionally there are numerous dining and shopping options for those who have time prior to take-off or those connecting to another city.
We arrived at and connected at the MacNamara terminal used by Delta etc. rather than the older north terminal used by Southwest American etc. which we had used on a previous trip. This terminal is relatively small clean and easy to use. We had a very short walk between gates. Almost disappointed we made our connection as I was secretly hoping we'd have to overnight and be put in the lovely Westin hotel that's in the terminal.
I flew AMS-DWT and then on to MKE at the end of May it was a fair walk from the arrival gate to immigration passing the US citizen entry area which was quite full I only had 1 hour left of my transfer time left so was a little apprehensive as to how long the queue for non US persons what a surprise around ten booths open and around twenty people yes 20 people queuing! I was chatting to the CBP guy for 5 minutes since there was no one behind me it seems that immigration had been full at 2pm with flights from 'Asia' but is slow at 3pm for a while. I continued on past baggage claim (I only had hand luggage) and on to security screening again no queues. The staff were very friendly and we chatted about the difference between DTW and the madness at ORD and I was on to my next flight around 20 minutes from leaving the plane and half of that was chatting to officials. The elevators bring you out in departures at the central train stop so on to the train to the north station and the gate was around 2 minutes walk as usual I checked the gate and time I had time to freshen up and bought a Philly Steak which was very nice and around $5.00 soon after they were calling the flight. I have used the airport before without problems I have to give DTW 10 out of 10. A quick note you can take food and drink you buy in the terminal on to planes in the US most people seem to since they don't serve more then pretzels on board it is called buy and fly.
The Customs procedure leaves something to be desired. We will not book another flight that goes through Detroit for international flights again. We were on a flight that originated in Barcelona then onto Amsterdam (where we did a complete security scan) onto Detroit. We passed through customs just fine with the declarations paper completed and verified by an officer before we collected our luggage. Then our luggage was late coming off the plane and by then other flights arrived making the customs line exceedingly long. We told 3 customs officers patrolling the area (there were another 4 just standing around doing nothing) that we had a flight leaving in 30 minutes. Each one said we would make it. Then we had to go through another security check (we just had one at the gate in Amsterdam). Well we missed the flight. The next one we were put on was leaving 6 hours later and did not have the option of an extra 4 inches of leg room previously purchased for our original flight. In Amsterdam by the way there was an express line through customs for those travelers that had a flight leaving in 30 minutes or less. Why US airports don't do this should be explored. Probably because it makes sense.
Passed through on the way to Japan and was pleasantly surprised. I like this airport very much. Very clean excellent signage excellent dining options (pricey but good) video boards with the playoffs on the walls everything seems to run smoothly. Also had comfortable chairs which is nice.
Travelled here from Schiphol in transit to Orlando arriving at 4.20 pm on 10 October 2013. Shortest TSA lines we have experienced ever and the agent was both polite and welcoming which is unusual in our past experience. He apologised as the computer system froze and he had to reboot - as did his colleagues. Took around 10 minutes to get back on line and thereafter very efficient. Baggage recheck very quick and security well staffed and again very polite particularly when dealing with children and one passenger in a wheelchair. Overall Detroit is now our favourite transit airport.
What should have been a simple flight turned into a nightmare. Gate C24 boarded plane was told plane there was a problem had to de-plane and walk all the way over to Gate B18 and get on a second plane. Then told there was another fault had to wait 20 minutes for them to fix it after 20 minutes we had to again de-plane and walk back to the C24 Terminal. Now on third plane - waiting. To compensate they offered me a complimentary can of pop and pretzels. A lousy airline!
Great stopover-airport to use for immigration. Immigration is always empty and within few minutes you are through the process. The airport itself is large but they have a train going thru the terminal which avoid long walks. Shops are ok. It is certainly a lot better than what you heard and read about the actual city of Detroit.
This airport is very large and long. It is just one tunnel. There are 3 train stops throughout the McNamara Terminal. However there are constant announcements telling people the time in Japanese Spanish and English. I can't however rate the restrooms due to my non-entering. This airport is very large and spacious. There is never a contest for seats.
McNamara (Delta's) terminal. Very fast security (<5 min) very clean aesthetic and airy. Very helpful staff good places to get a snack or a good meal that range from common and affordable chains to exclusive restaurants. Love their VINO bar. There is a hotel inside the terminal and free internet for 30 min. Very rare delays. Very fast luggage delivery. Probably the best airport in the country and the best place for transit. Very limited public transportation. Plenty of parking - the closest one (2-10 min walk to the terminal) is expensive - 20$/day.
Probably the best US airport. Customs and immigration very efficient. Out of the customs queue in 30 minutes (including re checking bags for connecting flight from an international arrival). TSA not surly as in other US airports. Good facilities and eating options. Free wifi but limited to only 30 minutes. Would make this my transit point when visiting Eastern US.
Delta uses Detroit for international flights. Good for return flights to Germany when you do not need to go through customs. Stopover time was little less than one hour and no problem. Walking distances are fair and they have a train to make it faster to get from one side to the other. OK duty free and other retail options. A convenient hub to go through.
Choose Detroit as a gateway airport on my journey from the UK via Amsterdam to Phoenix. Reviews promised reasonable TSA and a comfortable terminal with a train inside it. These promises were kept! The a/c docked at 2.23pm. At 3.23 I took a seat by the gate for my connecting flight. I'd allowed 2.5 hours for transfer and I did it 1 hour. Immigration were helpful - there were few US nationals and lots of internationals so they processed the US nationals in the US only area and then opened it up to non USA passport holders. Sensible. Flexible. Customs were fine. Next help was on hand to ensure transferring passengers sent their checked baggage to the right place. TSA processed us fairly and efficiently and before we knew it we were out in the terminal. There are 2 trains which shuttle back and forth incessantly so it's a quick way to the far end gates. Terminal staff seemed happy and helpful - even ground crew were getting merrily on with the work. The place had a very relaxed atmosphere though it was early afternoon with few flights. All in all it was a very good experience. I'd recommend Detroit as an easy entry to the US.
DTW is my home airport so I may be a little bias. Flew out of Delta terminal and it is still a world class terminal compared to other airports. Great restaurants and a lot of shopping to pass the time.
Flew in here for a transfer for the first time. It is probably one of the nicest major airports in the US. Well laid out lots of restaurant options tram to get from one end to the other of a very long terminal. All gate staff very nice. Cannot speak of terminal side stuff as only there for a transfer but for my next international trip would not hesitate to fly in and out of here.
Using this airport has always been our preference for entry into the US. Recently the care and support we received from so many employees at the airport along with officials has been outstanding. My in-laws traveled there recently with our son who has learning difficulties and they made every effort to make his passage through the facility as stress free as possible. At other airports help has been offered grudgingly and resentfully - here at Detroit Wayne it was offered professionally and effectively.
Nice clean efficient airport. I arrived during a snowstorm with active blowing snow and 5 degree weather. The airport didn't miss a beat with a fleet of ploughs keeping the runways clear and no apparent delays due to the weather. Nice tall ceilings and lots of windows give the airport a nice open feel. Moving sidewalks and transit train make quick time of getting from gate to gate.
It has been vastly improved since 2002 with its complete rebuild featuring the two new terminals. The McNamara terminal used by Delta and its SkyTeam partners continues to impress me since I wrote my previous review in 2006 (below). The distances in the overlong A concourse are covered effortlessly by the tram system and even the long walk to the end of the B and C concourses feature moving walkways along their entire distance. The best architectural feature is the light show tunnel connecting the B and C concourses with the main complex. The new North Terminal extends this welcoming atmosphere to the non-SkyTeam airlines that use the airport. With the exception of one overly rude person the employees have all treated me well here too and the amenities at both terminals are exemplary. Gone are the days of the old terminal system with their horrible congestion and decrepit upkeep. With Detroit's urban decay they might look to the airport for ideas on how to improve things elsewhere in the metropolitan area.
A great place to change planes as food and other services are noticeably better than most US airports. The corridors are very long but moving sidewalks and a tram make this manageable. Sky Clubs in the Delta terminal are noticeably better than those in ATL and most other airports - less crowded with very comfortable furnishings and sense of space and quiet.
DTW remains perhaps my favourite airport. I have used Terminal 3 times and encountered courtesy and friendliness from check in and security staff. Shopping facilities are fine Huge concourses but easy to find your way around and lots of seating. I have never had to change flights here so cannot comment on that and my only note of dissent would be the amount of time that it takes to get through incoming security. There never seems to be enough people on the gates.
The McNamara (South) terminal looked clean and modern and easy to traverse for passengers. However we arrived at and a few days later departed from the North Terminal. The terminal itself is clean and un-crowded but once we got our bags we had to take them up one level then cross a pedestrian bridge over the airport road then down to a lower level go outside and find the appropriate shuttle bus. Rental car facilities are some distance from either terminal. You have to go to the lower parking structure level of either terminal and then take a rather long convoluted trip to the facility. On the plus side I have no fault with the cleanliness of either terminal. Eating facilities were decent. TSA personnel at the North Terminal seemed brusque but that can obviously vary from shift to shift.
DTW's south terminals (Delta and affiliates) are well-designed and functional with better than average food and beverage options. Ideal for connections but not so much for O&D traffic as there are long walks/rides to the bag claim and rental car facilities.
Arrived from Dulles on Delta. A reasonable walk under the tunnel to the reclaim area. Bags arrived in good time and a short walk to the car park. I was out of the airport 30 mins after landing. Departure to Baltimore from McNamara Terminal. Checked in using self service machines easy to use. Bag drop quick and efficient many desks open so no queue. Security efficient. Walked to our gate but you could take the fast train a good food court and bar near gates A70.
DTW is a very nice clean and modern airport with a straightforward layout that is easy to navigate. For all of the bad economic news coming out of Detroit you would never think it from seeing the beautiful airport the city has.
Clean bright tall ceilings lots of windows. The ratio of seats to passengers is good. Same goes for bathrooms which are also clean. The McNamara terminal is one long line with repetitive stations where you can find flight monitors bathrooms ATMs and restaurants. It has even numbered gates on one side odd on the other. The bad : customs agents are not the nicest regional ground employees are stretched too thin.
This has become my favorite transfer point if I'm headed anywhere in the eastern US other than New York. DTW is just about the only US airport that strikes me as first world. It's intelligently designed with an internal metro system running the length of the main McNamara terminal and moving underground walkways to connect to the parallel B/C terminal. It's long and big but that's the nature of airports and the transit systems are easy to use and obvious. Food options are pretty decent too with a few choices that rise above the usual food court fare. Immigration and customs are about as painless as is reasonable to hope for given asinine TSA practices that reflect absurdly unrealistic US passenger expectations for security.
Delta terminal is excellent for making connections. Yes it is long--1 mile long to be exact-- but it's great for exercising when you have a long layover. There are also moving walkways and an indoor monorail that run the length of the A concourse. The A concourse and the B and C concourses are connected by a psychedelic light & sound tunnel. Don't rush if you don't have to-take it all in! Facilities terminal-wide are excellent with the best dining options in the A concourse although if you like burgers there is a Fuddrucker's in the C concourse.
My first connection flight thru Detroit. I sat business from Frankfurt so I was early off the plane to immigration. That part was handled virtually in 5 minutes. Very empty friendly staff - have seen that different in other US hubs. We had a delay ex Frankfurt I still managed my connection within less than 30 minutes between both flights. The facilities seemed to be ok. I had hardly any time to look around. Looks like an airport you can stand a layover.
Nice and clean but whoever came up with the stupid parallel and long terminal design clearly lacked imagination and must have been a runner. I don't know why they thought having only 1 connecting tunnel between terminals was a good idea and then made the main terminal super long but I think it could have been better designed. Never had a chance to check out the retail since I am too busy trying to make the connection. All I can say is that if you are connecting from a large jet to a regional flight have at least 45-60 mins between connections.
I connected for the first time in DTW with NWA. As previously mentioned the McNamara terminal is indeed VERY long. However it does have moving-steps and alas: its own metro system (with red trams like NWA's planes) - with tram stops along the way. Also the terminal is immaculately kept with a clean decor and floor to ceiling windows throughout. Add a wide array of dining and shopping options and you've got an award-winning product. Definitely better than ATL and even better than the pleasant Delta terminal in CVG.
Detroit Airport is one of the most interesting airports. Uniquely long stretch from one end to the other very clean facilities good dining and interesting duty-free shops. I loved the fact that the airport has a tram that travels very quickly from one end to the other at the top corner of the building. However security staff are not friendly especially the immigration sector when travelling in and out of Detroit to Tokyo.
Detroit Metro Airport (DTW) has good bus connection via Michigan Flyer serving East Lansing Ann Arbor and Jackson MI were it not for the fact that Metro Airport management refuses to allow signing of the bus stop location at the terminal The Landside Director insists that signage must be restricted to concessionaires (taxi companies). The Michigan Flyer was forced to remove a diagram showing the bus stop location from its own website. Also the airport authority removed all written material regarding the Michigan Flyer service and bus stops from the traveler's aid desk. As a senior arriving after a 24 hour international journey I was unable to find any airport personnel who could direct me to the bus stop. Exhausted and loaded with my luggage I took a bad fall in my hurried attempt to find the bus stop. Finally a police officer directing parking traffic gave me directions. Although I should have had ample time had I known where to go I barely made the lengthy distance to the unmarked bus stop in time. This lack of proper signage is totally unacceptable and contrary to public interest and safety.
DTW is the best airport I have visited. Have not experienced much delay in all the years that I have used it. Baggage claim was good. McNamara Terminal interior (I have used NW much) was excellent. Though the terminal is freakishly long (one mile) the walkways help ease walking. Customs was excellent (perhaps due to the fact that I am a US citizen). Oddly enough I have never used Dulles for international. My only complaint is that the security areas are compact and check-in can sometimes be inefficient.
I have travelled through Detroit on several occasions. McNamara terminal is very neat courteous security and check in airline staff. Lots of shops and things to do before your flight. The new North terminal is a big improvement from the old terminals! The security isn't as precise as I imagined but they were very friendly and cracking jokes. The only complaint I have is I purchased a new expensive set of luggage only for it to come out with several tar footprints on it! My luggage has been destroyed in a sense I flew through Detroit just a couple weeks ago and it has more footprints on it! Well at least it got there! I will fly through Detroit again in the future!
The immigration officials were a bit incompetent. Mostly due to lack of familiarity with computers. Airport facilities are fine and I had flown before through the airport. But immigration and customs are not like other US airports. I would avoid it if this is your port of entry because of this. Otherwise domestically it is fine.
Arrival at McNamara Terminal from London on NWA was smooth and efficient. Uncharacteristically Immigration Officers were polite! Baggage was delivered promptly and transfer to onward NWA domestic flight was painless. A sports bar at the airport provides a haven for smokers! All in all an excellent experience.
Nice airport easy directions. I arrived and departed at the Edward H. McNamara Terminal. Terminal was very clean and you found everything to eat or a quite area to read. Nice is the as well the Tram that you brings you easily from one end to the other. At Security you was asked in a very friendly why you are leaving and it was a smooth way from check in to the gate.
I found Detroit airport to be an easy airport to get around in. I arrived at the Smith Terminal and found the check in at American Airlines very quick and easy. I saw the line for security and thought it would take forever but moved along quite quickly and left me with about two hours to go before my flight. There were limited amount of places to eat Quiznos was every where and not much else. You could get a beer for an inflated price.
I have transited the DTW airport numerous times and found that it is a great facility. I arrived at gate 78 and my departure gate was gate 6 with 15 minutes to make the flight. Jumping on the tram made this easy and doable. Once you understand (it is easy) how to use the tram you can be in any part of Terminal A within minutes. If you have time there are a variety of place to eat that can fit any budget and many places to shop. There is an intriguing water/fountain feature in the middle of terminal where its fun just to people watch. The facility is clean with lots of bathrooms and really easy to get around.
For BA passengers the new terminal is a vast improvement from the old terminal BA used (1 food outlet /1 shop (always closed). On arriving the immigration/customs queues were quite long and slow must have waited 30-40 minutes. Checkin and security flying out was painless. The terminal design is not for everyone a narrow mile long structure with gates on each side. Plus Points
Having used both the McNamara and Smith terminals I find it safe to say that Detroit Metro is almost two different airports in terms of quality. The new McNamara terminal used by Northwest and its SkyTeam partners is a monumental improvement in terms of quality over that awful old Davey Terminal. Some distances can be long but unlike many airports of this size there are moving walkways (and the A concourse tram) the entire distance to your gate. The architecture though not entirely cutting-edge is very light and welcoming and the center mall area contains a wealth of dining and shopping. The Smith terminal (which serves all non-SkyTeam domestic airlines) on the north side of the airport is uncrowded but astonishingly dilapidated and depressing as some reviewers mention below. The new north terminal that is now being built will be a welcome relief from this antiquated and obsolete relic.
A great airport - clean modern well organized. The dining and shopping choices are excellent and I really don't mind having to spend a few hours in this airport. It's quite comfortable. Clearing customs is always fairly quick and efficient and the people who work at this airport tend to be very friendly and helpful. Even though I am not from Detroit when arriving at this airport from abroad I already feel home.
As a resident of the Detroit Metro area I have to say that the new terminal is definitely an improvement over the old one. Definitely get to this airport early - traffic can be horrible in the area and you'll want the extra time to clear the security. But once you get through the checkpoints the MacNamara terminal offers many opportunities to relax and enjoy yourself before your flight. You can catch a beer and a game (and a smoke if you so desire) in one of the bars peruse the various shops around the terminal or simply read a book or magazine that you can purchase from many different kiosks if you didn't bring one with you already. Generally very clean spacious-feeling and easy on the eye.
I was pleasantly surprised by DTW. The terminal is modern design is attractive food and shopping provide great selection and the staff no matter if airport or other is usually very friendly (not common at US airports according to my experience) - plus good news for smokers there is legal spot for smoking Fox Sport Bar right across the Sky lounge. Even the immigration process and customs are smooth and quick without pointless hassling and abusing the power of uniform. I admit the terminal is very long and narrow and can get crowded easily and the inside terminal tram can be confusing for first time visitors but the atmosphere and facilities are good and definitely beats majority of the US airports.
"I booked a ticket from Atlanta to Amsterdam via DTW on Northwest Airlines. After hearing the rave reviews about the new WorldGateway I had high expectations for it. However as soon as I stepped out of the gate I realized I had been let down. There are only three tram stations in the entire mile-long terminal so some walking is needed. It is easy to walk such distance in a normal scenario but toting a carryon bag does not help. Also senior citizens who have some difficulty walking will find the airport to be miserable for the same reason. The terminal is actually quite narrow so crowds cannot disperse too easily. If a family of eight or nine stops to look at an airport map a bottleneck will ensue as two or three people at a time try to make their way around the family. Besides the walking and crowds the choice of dining is minimal- besides the normal fast food chains and two or three restaurants there isn't too much more to expect. I found that my packed peanut butter sandwich was better than what most stores offered. After returning from Amsterdam I was faced with perhaps the rudest customs agents I have encountered. The agents barked orders to people who hardly knew English and made no efforts to explain things to them. In every other city I have cleared customs I've been greeted with a pleasant ""welcome home!"". Not this time. The man behind the counter grumpily stamped my passport and bade me farewell. Detroit's new terminal isn't all it's made out to be and I will make a point to avoid it in the future."
I've flown (international flights only) in and out of DTW several times since the new NW terminal opened and I can't believe what a massive improvement it's been. The food and shopping are great and the NW Worldclubs are really really nice. But coming in from London once our NW flight was prohibited from deplaning until all the passengers from a previous flight had cleared passport control. We had to stay on the plane at the gate an additional 50 minutes after landing and most of us missed our connections. The explanation the airport provided was that there was some rule permitting only one flight to clear passport control at a time - something I have never heard of at any other airport - and we were encouraged to write to the local legislators to complain. It was an utterly bizarre experience and one I still don't understand.
I've flown home several times from Montreal to my hometown Chicago on NW for the holidays good connections at the McNamara Terminal and impressive duty-free on the way back to Montreal. Just a tip for smokers as of January 2005 smokers could still enjoy a cigarette in the Fox Skybox Lounge located in the middle of the terminal near the duty-free shop. Used to airports like O'Hare and Montreal's Dorval which relegate smokers to the curb (more complicated in Montreal because you have to exit through US customs again to get back out!) this was a welcome surprise.
"Everything is slow in this airport with lots of mosquito's. Toilets filthy and the attendant is not shy to ask for a tip. Security on departure is non-existent. Broken down x-rays machines, not working displays with gate information. Luggage on arrival takes ages, so does immigration. Everything with pen and paper, no computers? All the duty free shops sell the same things at the same prices. "
"It is like a tale of two airports - departure was a breeze (though there was some confusion about whether we needed to pay the new departure tax) with a quick check in and quick immigration, while arriving was the usual chaotic scrum. Immigration took about 30 minutes though there wasn't really a queue to speak of. Upon leaving we did find a desk offering reasonably priced transfers (with a little bargaining of course). I was surprised to see some nice new toilets in the departure area though the airport still lacks a good array of eateries (and the shops all sell basically the same things). There is also a lack of places to sit once are in the departure area (except at the gates after the security check)."
Was in Dhaka again a few days ago. Arrival procedures slow again very slow it takes ages to get your luggage. Immigration is from the 50's paper and paper work as others say here: mosquitos are the real hassle in the airport this time the toilets at immigration were available. Departure: there was a cricket match going on on TV meaning all staff in shops restaurants and security were more interested in the game then serving you.
"Bangladesh is chaos so is the airport. Upon arrival had to wait more than 1 hour before I saw my bag on the belt. Immigration reasonably fast but be aware no toilets there. Upon departure a few days later security had to be bribed as they saw a bottle of wine in my bag which ""was not allowed"". At the gate security non-existent x-ray machine broken down people scanner broken down and then there is a guy in plain clothes padding your jacket that is what you call security? Duty free shops there are at least 6 of them all selling the same stuff. Toilets adequate and yes there are 2 smoking rooms."
Having lived in Dhaka for almost 3 years during which time I have travelled through both the Dhaka domestic and international terminals more times than I can remember. During my time in Dhaka there have been some very minor improvements although none that I have seen in the domestic terminal. E.g. there is now a decent barista coffee shop and a few new duty free shops (although a number of them sell nothing except chocolate and cosmetics - no alcohol) in the departure lounge. However overall the Dhaka airport still ranks as one of the worst anywhere in the world. It is extremely dirty bathroom facilities are disgusting staff are rude and generally unhelpful immigration is a joke (locals are allowed to queue anywhere including in the lanes marked Foreign Passport and VIP only) check-in is terrible again people can que anywhere (business or economy). The place is full of dengue carrying mosquito. The only minor saving grace is the AMEX business lounge which is relatively clean but the food is pretty bad and you get 1 only complimentary drink after which they are expensive.
I think Dhaka international airport lounge is quite decent clean and has been improving. Ok its not Dubai standard but better than many international airports in the region like India. The free wifi is the best I have seen so far in comparison to other airports I have used. The coffee in the small cafe is quite good and not over priced. If you are buying chocolate the prices are reasonable. The seats could be improved.
I have travelled through Dhaka international airport quite a few times in the last five years. I am not sure why people say it is improving as it is not. It stays exactly the same just like anything else government run in the country. All government institutions have an absolute aversion to any sort of change. There are a few less mosquitoes in the baggage claim area that is the only positive thing I can say. Immigration on arrival means long and slow moving queues. The Ruposhi Bangla business lounge is poor with limited seating and similarly limited range of snacks and drinks. The wifi did not work on my way out. The City Bank Amex lounge looks better so getting a card if you are a regular visitor could be worthwhile. They also have the only lounge in the domestic terminal. The domestic terminal has improved a bit over the last few years. The departure lounge is clean and the air conditioning working.
I often visit Bangladesh every time I go I see improvements. Airport staff are friendly immigration services are just cool duty free shop's are also okay. The whole airport is quite clean. Custom services are also good if you have declared correctly then it's smooth. One thing they need to have are public phones on site.
"I have been through DAC a few times the past months and it has much improved. Immigration especially on departure is efficient and waiting times down to minutes in the foreigners lines. Visas on arrival now issued for many nationalities and becoming popular. When leaving it is worthwhile entering the departures from door 6 at the far end given its much quieter and ""reserved"" for visiting businessmen etc. Not much to do in the departures lounge and food and drink facilities limited. But it certainly works well these days and with a few cosmetic changes and improved airside refreshment then DAC will be well on its way."
They have separate immigration counters for foreign passport holders but no one cares. Anticipate a long wait. Over all - chaos. Be careful with your luggage.
Thousands of money changers and touts and assorted hanger ons. Can be a confronting sight. BA flight was smooth. Immigration queues long. As soon as you are out of the arrivals area a bunch of touts will pounce upon you with offers of cheap taxis good exchange rates hotels the works. Do not transit through this airport. If you are travelling to Bangladesh then of course you don't have much of a choice. Give yourself plenty of time when departing. Take a print out of your e-ticket.
Well our arrival into DAC was terrible with long queues at the immigration desks and baggage that seemed to take forever to appear. However our departure from DAC was so smooth. Check in was straightforward and there was no line at the foreigners immigration desk. There isn't much to do at the airport aside from a few shops but when we were there (mid morning) it was fairly quiet so we walked up and down the length of the airport past all of the gates and watched the cargo planes being loaded up. The toilets there are ok.
On my last trip through DAC things went fairly well. No queue to check in for Jet Airways and no one else in the foreigners immigration queue. Airside is fairly boring but there is a reasonable restaurant as well as two duty free shops. Baggage reclaim on arrival took a long time (arriving on Malaysia Airlines) but getting a Visa on Arrival was very quick and easy. The domestic terminal is small and fairly efficient. There is very little to do in the terminal but check in only opens 1 hours before departure so this shouldn't be a problem. Staff in both terminals seemed friendly and toilet facilities were bearable.
Every time I visit the airport I have to face really long queues both before departure and after landing. The airport is not at all clean and there isn't much to do at the airport. The airport staff aren't very friendly or helpful. The worst part is collecting your luggage. I had to wait for over an hour at times around the luggage belts to collect my bags (I usually travel with 1 or 2 bags). But the Wi-Fi connection is quite good actually.
Update to my review dated June 2009. Used the airport again in January 2012. Immigration was fine not excessive waiting. But avoid arrival on a large aircraft (in our case an Emirates B777). On Emirates everyone is given a 30 kg baggage allowance and uses it to maximum effect to import consumer items from the Middle East (e.g. giant TV screens). That combined with a totally inadequate baggage handling system led to a two hour wait for our bags - not an ideal welcome after long flights from UK. Basically everything ceased up because not enough people were removing what bags had arrived to clear spaces for more to be loaded on to the single belt in use. Departure was thankfully less fraught due to early arrival so queues were avoided. But the free computer terminals for the Internet have been removed and there is no wi-fi. Be warned if you haven't spent all your Taka changing money back to US$ (no other currency apparently available despite having tills full of a whole range of currencies) is not easy. The kiosk in the departure area beyond Immigration is rarely staffed but there is another downstairs back through Immigration which they cheerfully waved us through and back again(!) where they grudgingly allowed to exchange back to hard currency. They insist on seeing the initial exchange receipt from when we changed money upon arrival so hang on to it and plan your spending to avoid the hassle!
Dhaka airport is quite busy not that clean but okay. Duty free is expensive while not up to the mark. Toilet facilities should be much improved. Immigration on departure - queuing time is high in rush hours. They couldn't even recognize my e-Boarding pass and I had to wait until a supervisor came over. On the announcement of boarding native people were running to board as if someone else would take away their seats! On arrival immigration service is faster luggage takes some times to arrive taxi service is poor and not trustworthy. Despite lot of issues food in the duty free area restaurants is quite good also the food in the business class lounge is nice.
Small and peaceful airport. The queues can be long at times but from starting my journey from my home to immigration was completed in 30 minutes! Adequate seating airside. Washrooms okay (except near the luggage belt - horrible). Duty free and restaurants - expensive and best to avoid.
I frequently travel to Dhaka from the UK. I find that from leaving the plane and going for my luggage is absolutely professional. The immigration at Dhaka are very good and pleasant. Customs do their job the only issue is that the luggage does take a while. The Bangladeshis will go out their way to help you. All staff at the airport are helpful. On the outward journey the only issue is if you need to contact anyone lack of phone booths at a reasonable price. All in all I would give it 4 out of 5. Very good I've been to worse. Turkey Spain Ireland and Greece to name but a few are a lot worse than Dhaka.
"Not customer friendly airport at all although some improvements made lately i e new shops and cleaner toilets. Departure is mostly fine go to the Sheraton lounge at the third floor and enjoy a cold beer while waiting for departure. Arriving though is horrible expect long queues to passport control and anywhere between 2-3 hours for the luggage to arrive. Arrange someone to pick you up since ""taxis"" are unreliable."
This is by a long way the worst airport I have been in. On entering it is utter chaos with touts sprinting behind your car so as to grab your luggage when you stop. It takes a raised voice to get them to go away usually. Some even pretend to be from your airline and say it is part of the service. They will then demand money when they have taken your bags in. The security is pretty woeful. The very old scanning machine is manned by totally disinterested looking staff who to be frank do not look like they know what they are looking for. It is also quite easy to walk around the metal detector when staff are not looking. Check in is ok. But there is a complete lack of information if your flight is delayed. Immigration is quite a slow process as often there machines break down and details have to be hand written. The shops and restaurant facilities are absolutely miserable. The duty free guys will try to rip you off especially if you try to pay Taka and not USD. The Sheraton bar upstairs is a bit more peaceful but hardly fantastic. Boarding the flight is chaos. As soon as there is a hint that boarding may begin there is a stampede to get to the front of the queue. I feel like reminding people that seats are allocated by ticket this is not a Dhaka bus! Arriving I feel is even worse. The immigration officers are slow. There is no machine readable passport system so everything is written down at a glacial speed. Friends who have asked for visa on arrival have been taken away to interview rooms and a bribe has been directly demanded. The luggage wait can be beyond belief. I have waited for well over an hour on occasions with no explanation of where the cases have been. Cases are also routinely tampered with. And as for exiting the airport and looking for a taxi- scary!
"Just traveled in and out of Zia International Airport on international trip. It has improved since my last visit 4+ years ago. There's a ""health desk"" at the arrivals hall manned by health professionals but does not seem to serve any purpose; no one at the immigration desks that follow ask about the form. Although there are separate immigration counters for Bangladesh Passport Holders Non-Resident Bangladeshis nationals of other South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and Foreigners in effect there are only two gateways: foreign passport holders and Bangladesh passport holders. The arrivals hall is all very civilized but the time it takes for the luggage carousels to start delivering checked luggage varies: it's quicker for day-time arrivals and dreadfully slow during the post mid- night hours. Departure check-in varies airline to airline; it's a lot quicker if you checked in online via the web. Departure immigration is no non-sense friendly and professional. There are two smoking rooms at either ends of the terminal on the air-side on the departure level. There are a few duty free shops selling both Bangladeshi export quality products such as leather bags cases shoes etc. as well as stores selling run of the mill duty free stuff (cigarettes perfumes). There are not many public phone booths that are working as most people use cellphones. Not the most interesting place on the face of the earth but there are worse places to be stuck in that part of the world."
Arrival - immigration reasonably efficient with average queuing time (10 - 15 minutes for an Airbus 330 load). Baggage return slow - about 30 minutes. Taxi area outside the terminal is chaotic
No problems with immigration or baggage delivery now. There is quite a good selection of shops/cafes in the departures area. If you are leaving on a large aircraft (Emirates) there are not enough seats in the gate area. So it is best to go to the gate early or late. There are some problems with mosquitoes in the airport so it is best to wear long sleeved shirts.
I have recently returned from Bangladesh to the UK and I think that overall Zia International has improved over the years but the actual facilities are still very limited in regard's to meeting the modern air travel standards. I think there should be more impetus on staff training and both in the smooth handling of the passengers and the overall customer service element. The shops and restaurants in the airport itself does not reflect the current trends in the modern Dhaka Metropolis as this is a shame as Zia International is used by many tourist on route to other destinations where the impact of the Airport can be used to market Bangladesh effectively.
A few tips for Dhaka ZIA. If departing there is a nice cafe on the first floor that few people know about. Alternatively sit away from the gates near to passport control- there are lots of seats there and its quiet. On arriving if you need transport walk away from the terminal and jump into an auto rickshaw/baby taxi or get a taxi from the roundabout just outside the airport. I like this airport- people are friendly many other passengers are curious about foreigners and things seem to work well here
ZIA has improved - much bigger and cleaner now including the restrooms. The effective space of the airport has doubled. Immigration customs check-in lobby everything is much more spacious. Immigration officers are still learning their software but they are courteous. The main trouble point is still the arrival curb and the taxi area. That place is still chaos and needs to be straightened out. Those who have cars waiting should not have any problem - but others will be at the mercy of the swindlers. Overall the airport has come a long way - luggage unloading was really quick took us less than 20 minutes to get out of the airport. The airport could use some restaurants and shops though.
Dhaka s getting better. Passport control is a bit slow. Only a few shops and at arrival the duty free is very low stocks and doesn't take any credit cards. Baggage claim need to be improve and faster. A Taxi cab booth needs to be opened inside the terminal building so people don't get hassled by the cab drivers and middle men. Custom checks should be quicker and liberal for the long journey passengers. All other things are nice - friendly staff clean secured and quiet.
Departure from Dhaka airport is much better than the arrival. However the arrival also on the side of OK. The main problem in arrival is to get a transport after exiting the terminal. Full of taxi agents and chaos. After renovation it is nice clean modern and most importantly very spacious. Although the airside facilities are limited only into a small duty free shops and couple of restaurants its ok these days as you dont have to wait a long time as there is almost no transit passenger.
Check-in is usually a bit busy but everyone is polite and it works OK. Immigration queues are longer for Bangladeshis than foreigners as there are generally many more Bangladeshis. Once through there is a lovely Sheraton cafe on the first floor which everyone can access but its always very quiet and relaxing compared to the pretty tacky cafe on the ground floor. No real shops to speak of but to be honest thats a refreshing change these days. Arrivals - if you are at the back of the plane the queue at immigration will be long by the time you get there. If flying to Dhaka try to get a seat near the front of economy so you can get to the immigration before the crowds. Everyone is very friendly and the hall is spacious. Baggage is sometimes slow and exiting the airport can be a bit daunting.
I found the airport to be reasonable. Immigration was a bit slow on the way in. No other problems though. On the way out there are a limited number of shops/restaurants. The airport is quite modern and clean. Even the toilets are OK. The domestic terminal is quite small but again not too bad.
Departure facilities are excellent. Ground staff of the airline you are flying will largely determine your experience. They are usually quite good in Dhaka. Arrival facilities are a mixed bag. Immigration signs are large and clear upon disembarking your aircraft. Passport Control slow but functioning. Nothing to worry about. Baggage handling a bit messy. Conveyor belts are on two sides of passport control. I went back and forth between the two since they kept changing their minds about where to dump our luggage. Eventually they settled on one belt. Note: Bags can arrive on a belt adjacent to the one they mentioned on the board. Also the new conveyor belts are a little narrow meaning your suitcases have a hard time staying on them. Look around a bit if you cannot find your bags. If you are arriving from Europe or North America you may be asked to jump the queue and exit the terminal ahead of those arriving from the Middle East who are subject to rigorous customs checking. Arriving in Dhaka would be a more pleasant experience if baggage handling was more disciplined. It must be mentioned that people who have travelled to Dhaka over the last few years will definitely appreciate that things are however much better that they used to be.
More qualified & smart people should work at the immigration. Most of them do not know about transit visas tourist visas and rules followed by other major countries. I always find them asking to their so called seniors for advise. The parking area has become a taxi stand for the unmarked microbuses. There should be specific number of airport taxis and no authorized help person at the arrival hall otherwise the re-entry is horrible. This country will take long time to rise if the airport is not found friendly and comfortable by the foreign visitors/investors.
Zia Airport - though improved still needs a lot of help. While the airport has new boarding gates and the arrivals now boast new luggage belts the appearance of the airport is still cute unclean and the layout leaves a lot to desire for. On arrival why do passengers have to go through such long series of stairs to the immigration area? I noticed some elderly folks with large carry on pieces struggling to walk down those stairs. In the arrivals hall immigration processing is way too slow. Under a new directive all information is keyed in computers to a database while a passenger enters and exits the country. Unfortunately this takes an incredible amount of time to enter all the info. I don't know why the process cannot be streamlined by scanning the passport info into a database and the keying in done at some other location at a later time. The customs area is working in better condition and I am very glad for it. The area where passengers take cars from the arrivals area is still chaotic although blocking general public access is a good idea. They still need to filter out taxi/porter and agents from this area. The departure immigration procedure is equally painful. I nearly missed my flight waiting for the line to move. It took 40 minutes for the 6 passengers in front of me to clear immigration. Boarding gates are ok but can they not put news on the tv in waiting areas rather than music tv? I guess that is partly due to the taste of the passengers so I can't complain much. As for the domestic terminal it runs a lot better than the international one. Check is for the two airlines is neat and easy. The terminal lounge is clean. The arrivals area is now graced with a luggage belt so it is definitely more efficient.
Improvement within a span of a couple of years. Hopefully more to come. It's no Singapore or Dubai but it's no Mumbai or Calcutta either. Small efficient and tidy for the most part. Transit passengers may be bored during long breaks. Not a lot to do. Next improvement must involve changing of several security personnel who ruin the day by their misguided pride in their work. First time foreigners with no one to meet may still be perplexed at the chaos once outside the neat terminal.
ZIA has gone through extensive renovations and has become an excellent airport. The new departure terminal is very comfortable. The new VIP Lounge for business and first class passengers is excellent. Impressive!
I have flown 8 outbound and 7 inbound international flights through ZIA in last seven years. The airport checking-in and immigration layouts have been remarkably improved during last two years. The departure portion is now comparable to most other international airports. The new parking structure attached to the main terminal is a great job done. The arrival portion is still messy specially outside the airport. Placing transparent glass between the baggage unloading people and the baggage claiming passengers has also reduced the baggage cutting (stealing) disasters. Thanks ZIA. We would like to see more continuous improvements.
Luggage handling for arriving passengers takes a very long time. One can also see the handlers tossing luggage on the conveyor belts not a pretty site. A yellow cab booth should be opened somewhere inside the terminal building so people don't get hassled by the cab drivers and middle men.
Zia Intl Airport have gone through some renovations lately to make it in to a functional clean and comfortable airport for travelers. However one area where there's a lot of scope for improvement is the duty free shop. Going in to the duty shop at the Dhaka airport foreigners would definitely want to find stuff to take back home that represent Bangladesh. Currently there's very little in that shop that gives an essence of Bangladesh.
Why don't we see and real-time arrival/departures for ZIA international airport at Dhaka ? Does this airport consider itself a major airport ? It must link it's real-time flight arrival/departures to internet sites which would be very valuable contribution towards passenger satisfaction.
Dhaka's Zia International Airport has improved a lot in the past few years. Even though it is not comparable to other major airports Zia Intl. is in very good condition compared to airports in India & Pakistan and the rest of the region. The departure and arrival terminals are comfortable and well maintained.
Had the misfortune to travel through this cow shed last week. The small quantity of multitasking staff there are more than happy to do as little as possible and ensure that everyone has an unpleasant experience. The customs and security staff especially behave as if they are secret police in charge of the White House rather than some backwater airfield. You have to queue too long for everything if you have to check a bag in you will have to show your passport and boarding pass to 4 separate people at different stages who are all within 20 meters of each other. What is the point of this - just jobs for the boys no doubt. When you have reached the departure lounge you find not enough seats 3 small air conditioners which are all useless. You will only find a couple of vending machines which don't accept notes only coins. I had to go back out through security to get some change for the vending machines. The 2 security staff members I tried talking to refused to speak English to me when only 5 minutes earlier I had heard them talking decent English with another passenger. Finally I found someone who would talk English and explained to them why I needed to return land side. All in all a very unpleasant experience I recommend anyone not to use this pathetic excuse of an airport.
Though they only have 2 or 3 flights a day mainly budget airlines the queues are never ending and final calls for outbound flights are broadcast before the inbound aircraft has even landed. The stress levels that you will experience travelling through DNR are comparable to no other airport I have experienced. The unfriendly staff go out of their way to make your journey unpleasant. Services and facilities at this airport are non-existent which is understandable due to the very low number of flights it is basically just a shed in a field with a runway. I would suggest avoiding DNR at all costs and using BA or AirFrance to fly to NTE (Nantes) or ANE (Angers) or UIP (Quimper) as an alternative.
Small airport that you would not want to spend too much time in but that manages to get you on your way reasonably quickly. Inbound immigration and visa on arrival facilities are slightly chaotic though not too bad. Outbound once you clear passport control facilities are limited to not-so-clean toilets a sad looking duty free shop a bar that did not have any change when we visited and a seating area that seemed to be full of mosquitos. If you've stayed in the Kempinski you can use their lounge which is probably the best part of this airport.
Chaos from the time we checked in to the time we got aboard the plane. On arrival we were herded into a small arrivals area with people wandering around trying to find out whether we get our visas first or our passports stamped first. No organisation whatsoever. Departure was delayed by 4+hrs and this airport is not the one you would choose to be delayed in. Toilets were available but were in a disgusting state. The Duty free shop was nearly empty and the range offered very small that is unless you wanted perfume
Departure Tax - reported to be $30 or EUR25. We didn't have to pay it. There was a passport check prior to getting our visas stamped where 'tax' was mentioned. We just looked blank at this and the guy who actually stamped the passport didn't ask us again. Facilities: well not really up to an international airports. There are toilets and a bar and two or three little shops but that's about it.
I flew from YYZ to AMD via Doha (old airport). Overall experience is not so bad except transporting to plane by coach. Embarking from and boarding to plane is by coach but overall management of coaches are good. Security check is quite fast and not so much hold up. Security personal are not checking for liquid in your hand baggage and line moves really nicely. This is for transfer and not sure about passenger boarding from Doha. Airport terminal is quite clean and roomy. Good part is there is a nice play area for young kids and reasonably good quality free WiFi. Washroom are no so clean mainly due to culture of people using them and mostly wet. In rush hours it is crawded and also sometime close one in middle due to close off that area (US bond flights). Not so much food option but overall food is not so costly compare to European airports. Ground staff are not that helpful but Qatar Airways staff are excellent. I missed new terminal by only 4-5 days.
I was here on a stopover on the way to Bangkok. I didn't have too many problems and the terminal wasn't that crowded (it was early morning). Also free internet worked well which was helpful. Staff seemed friendly though not really helpful. The toilets were overcrowded and not clean. Not many shops or restaurants that I saw. Overall this airport is nothing to right home about but my experience wasn't that bad. Qatar airways is a good airline and hopefully the new airport in Doha is better than Doha international.
Passed through Doha on both 25th March and 15th April. Very disappointed with business class lounge which was very crowded and hectic. Couldn't find a cup to pour coffee in! Not anywhere close to buffet. Differing advice about our time and gate of departure meant we only had ten minutes to spare. The gates were in chaos Didn't appreciate having to climb stairs to board. Doha really wants to shake itself and look to the super business class lounge they have at Heathrow.
Arrived with our baby myself and my husband were forced to get on the fully packed bus that brought us to the arrival terminal as my request to wait for the next bus was denied. As such I had to struggle while carrying my baby in my arms through the dreadful bus ride standing and trying not to fall on anyone while the bus made sharp turns during the 20 minute ride. No one offered me a seat as expected because no one sitting or standing near any seats could see me carrying a baby in that super crowded bus. No assistance or clear information regarding a fast lane at the immigration hall. Immigration officer was very rude and made us go to another counter at the other end of the immigration hall. Our passports were handed over to three different officers and when asked why and what was happening all questions were ignored and we were treated as though we were invisible as they spoke to each other in Arabic. Horrible experience and airport is a far cry from any other airports I have passed through. And very stressful for someone like us travelling with a baby.
Very sad airport. There seems to be plenty of toilet cleaners but the toilets are crowded not so clean and far too few in numbers. The business class lounge is the worst I have seen. The options for eating are severely limited Costas and one other similar place. Not very exciting for a delay of several hours. The single runway means every plane is going to be late. The runway just cannot handle the number of flights and then the terminal cannot handle the number of passengers. We waited one hour to land circled at 15000 feet and then later for the next flight sat on the tarmac all ready to go for 70 minutes before actually taking off. The staff are amiable but unhelpful. The transfer desk was overwhelmed trying to arrange the hordes of passengers who missed flights. The new airport or new terminal has been rumoured to be coming soon for the last couple of years. Alas too late they have lost me.
"Disabled assistance at Doha airport is incredibly chaotic and inefficient. I have vowed never to fly Qatar Airways again after this. Upon arrival my disabled husband and I were herded into a ""special area"". Our passports were taken off us. About 15 mins before our flight was to depart I began to panic and make a fuss (otherwise we weren't going anywhere). They finally loaded us and another disabled passenger onto a special bus to take us to the plane. About 5 mins on the other passengers noticed that they had left her bag with her passport/boarding pass behind so we had to go back. Finally with all bags we get to the plane and the flight has been closed they had to radio for permission from the pilot to reopen the door to let us on. This was granted thankfully and has now delayed the flight. And also no surprise the seat needed by my husband due to his disability had been commandeered by a passenger thinking we hadn't turned up. Don't travel via Doha Airport if you need special/disabled assistance."
Whilst I agree about the time taken to get to the plane by bus I felt that I should add my recent experience of Doha International Airport to redress the balance somewhat. I found it to be a smooth trouble free experience. It took approx 25 minutes from the time that we left our hotel in Doha to the time we were sitting at the gate waiting for our plane to be called (admittedly this was at midnight). There were lots of people about but minimal queues everywhere and the staff that we had cause to speak to were friendly and helpful (including the security man). Perhaps it's a different experience when you're not a transit passenger?
After flying from LHR I had a 1 hour transfer before flying on to Western Australia. This was my first experience of Doha and it wasn't great a 20 minute bus journey took us from the plane to the quick transfer building where I wandered about trying to find the gate the usual queues for security etc. followed by another 20 minute bus journey back to the next aircraft. No time for the toilet food or shopping. Airport was incredibly busy narrow walkways make movement difficult. Hopefully my return (June) will be better but can't imagine I'll be back after that.
Will avoid in future. We were in transit and after a long bus ride in (nearly 20 mins) from the plane there was a long queue to clear security where despite being on the colour coded short transfer queue we found the world and his wife going through the supposedly quick short transfer queue to avoid the long queue in ordinary transfer queue. None of the airport staff seemed to care so what's the point ? As a result we only just made our transfer time and then had another 19 minute bus ride out to the next plane (I timed it). The toilet in the terminal was so crowded and smelly we didn't bother use them. Forty minutes in a bus and queues for thirty minutes just to get onto a plane parked 200 metres from the one we landed in! Never again.
It has all been said by other reviewers but I am so angry with this airport that I will add to the comments. Long bus ride long queues for everything (passport control duty free toilets - I tried three and gave up) then another long bus ride. In and out of the planes up outside steps in the heat or rain. Truly horrible experience at 1am after an already long flight surreal really. Would not fly Qatar again whilst they are using this airport (and I may not bother even when they move to the new airport).
Flew through again on the 19th of December and the new terminal really is needed. Forty minutes of bus journeys and over crowded business lounge again. In addition Qatar airways do not let platinum/emerald card holders use the 1st class lounge!
Flew into Doha Airport from London. We had a 6 hour transit before heading to Bangkok. Arrived at 2am and it felt like a ghost town. We were traveling in Business on Qatar and the Business lounge wasn't very good compared to other countries. It's very over rated and as a seasoned traveler I was very disappointed with the lack of 24 hour service I have had in Asian airports. The lounge already feels very worn and tattered and they only served tea and coffee and soggy sandwiches. If they are trying to compete with Dubai they have no chance in winning. Even compared to old European lounges it didn't strike me as anything too exciting. We even took the shuttle bus to the main airport and the lounge there was tiny and packed so we came back to the Qatar business lounge.
Stopped at Doha airport for a two hour transit en route ZUR-MEL. Even with a young baby it wasn't as bad as I had expected. The bus ride was long but thankfully my wife and child had a seat. Going through security when arriving at the departure terminal took no more than 5 mins. Security at the gate also took no more than 10 mins. Even though we were there during the midnight rush it was busy but not uncomfortable.
Connected from Bangkok to Cairo and back. First experience in Doha. The colour system they have for various passengers is great (yellow tags and cards for transfers Orange for quick transfers etc.). The terminal itself is just a glass box (I expected a larger venue) but functioned well. Clean with a couple of shops here and there but I believe the new airport is to open soon and would reflect Qatar's ambition to offer a world class airport. This one works but lets say it lacks any lustre for me its a non issue as long as all worked fine. The internet is free and appreciated even though works only on one side of the terminal and closer to gate 20 21 22 the signal is barely there and connection almost impossible. Staff are polite especially in the x-ray checks (which is a big issue for me especially in other Middle eastern airports). The only negative point is the people jammed downstairs when boarding the bus. For 2 flights the passengers were lead down but the bus wasn't there yet and it was very uncomfortable having a small room packed with people kids and screaming toddlers. But all in all it went rather well. Toilets need a bit of a face lift!
Transited here twice during November 2013. As others have pointed out the bus transfers from the plan are the longest I have ever come across - and there is the inevitable confusion for some passengers between the Doha arrival and transit/departures stop which can cause some chaos. Overall the airport terminal for transit was not as bad as I feared - plenty of seats in the downstairs area and a nice coffee shop close to the toilets. However buying anything from duty free is a slow process - I tried to buy a bottle of water and had to wait nearly 10 minutes while the cashier filled out volumes of paperwork for another customer who was just buying one bottle of whisky. And after all the drama the passenger left his boarding card behind! Its bearable as a transit stop - but the sooner the new Doha airport opens the better. I was there in November - so maybe that is why it seemed quieter!
Perhaps I've been lucky with the immigration queues but I've found immigration in and out of Doha to be fairly quick and straightforward - though make sure you have a credit card to cover the visa fee
As I had only 1 hour 20 minutes between landing from Manchester and catching the next flight to Bangkok I'd booked the Al Maha fast track service which I can really recommend I was rushed through the usual crowds and chaos of Doha and escorted direct to the departure gate so I can't really comment about delays etc although the terminal seemed to be a crowded as usual. On my return flight I'd used Q-miles to upgrade to business from Doha to Manchester as I was in transit for 8 hours the premier terminal is the place to be if you have 8 hours with nothing to be expect sit and wait for the next flight a fine choice of foods and top class staff there seem to be more of them since my last visit I just hope the HAMAD finally opens they'll have done something about the crowds and queues. Most of the below marks are based on premier terminal.
Every time I am at the airport I see at least half the passengers disembark on the wrong section (transit) and I find them coming back. This takes too much time just because the busses we travel do not have voice over instructions. This could save ground staff so much hassle. The crowd in immigration is usually quite large but the egate card works for us.
This airport is a joke for all the tall claims Qatar Airways or their ads make. The Airport is a disaster starting with the longest bus ride from the plane to the Terminal (at time waiting at the door of the plane as the Bus has not yet found its way to us). Once you get to the terminal things get worse. There are two or three outlets where you can buy food. The selection is rubbish service is shabby. The prices are over the top. The available lounges are small and most of the time they refuse to honour the complimentary access assured by our Credit Cards (Platinum and above). I would hate to be stranded there more than an hour or so.
To the previous reviewer: are you sure you are talking about Doha airport? The airport of 2-3 wide-body jets arriving at the same time at 1 am and turning the security area into mayhem. Small and cramped departure areas where people are herded one hour before the boarding and are forced to sit on the floor due to lack of seating? Dingy and smelly toilets. Long bus rides around the runway where often the driver is himself unsure at which aircraft he has to stop. Surly and brusque customer service? Bad ventilation and simply not enough space to contain QR expansion. My last experience was all of the above and worse. Much as I like flying QR I hate this airport and will avoid it until the new terminal opens.
I cannot understand the very bad reviews of this airport. My husband and I are in our 60's. We had a stop over in Doha visa everything went smoothly. Check in back at the airport fine. The departure lounge is fine eating and shopping. Toilets no problem. We found a seat again without a problem. The bus ride to and from the plane does not take long buses are used in lots of airports. (Our flight arrived in Doha at 01.15am and our departure was 08.45am). We shall have no hesitation when next we travel to Malaysia to use Qatar airways with a stopover in Doha.
I found arrival with Qatar Airways excellent customs was fast and for the region ok in friendliness. Visa upon arrival possible by credit card and directly at customs check though depending on nationality I guess. Taxis wait outside just around the corner. I found especially departure in the main terminal disturbing for Qatar-standards. I must again admit that check-in customs and security-checks went smooth and fast however that is it. There are few shops that basically all sell the same tax-free items if not coffee. Most disappointing was the food court and choice it was probably amongst some of the poorest I ever seen after travelling to quite some airports in different parts of the world. There are hardly tables available and half of them is reserved for airport and airline staff of which some noisy as well. Ordering service was chaotic and food quality was below average. Also the fact bus transport is used for every flight where you would have expected air-conditioned walking bridges in Qatar instead is a very annoying thing and may indeed take a while to reach the airplane. Toilets not clean and smelly as well. Too bad for Qatar Airways.
Qatar is a great airline however Doha is the worst airport for a transits. No airbridges long bus rides from aircraft to terminals (very confusing system) crowded toilets even in the middle of the night. It was very tiring and wouldn't want to fly through Doha again.
Travelled through Doha in September. Very cheap airport lots of bargains in duty free shops very cheap beverages and food. Waited four hours for next plane on the way back to London and because it was after midnight airport was quiet with plenty of seats in the main area and Quiet Zone. Different story on the way to Bangkok. Late afternoon on the way to Bangkok completely different story. Overcrowded dirty toilets no seating left. Smoking rooms are a big joke avoid if you can no sufficient ventilation and too many people inside. Bus service to and from the plane was fast. Overall would not recommend this airport for staying longer than one hour.
"This has got to be one of the worst airports I have been in. Mainly due to the archaic use of busses that take over 20 minutes to get to and from the aircraft to the terminal. And then when checking in with the extremely polite staff everyone must hurdle into a 2nd waiting room to wait for the bus. The lack of services at the airport are very poor. 2 or 3 restrooms tops that have a line out the door for men are packed and in locations not convenient to all passenger waiting areas. Since the current airport is so small the food and shopping options are extremely limited and the shopping is limited to duty free items (and over-priced electronics). The 1 great thing about this airport is the ""Quiet Area"" where it is dark reclining seats and very quiet if you have a long layover. Made for nice place to nap."
This airport desperate for an upgrade. The big fancy new Doha airport has had its opening delayed for several years and it shows as Qatar Airlines continues to expand its massive fleet despite the tiny overwhelmed airport that serves as its transit hub. A few problems to note: 1) The bathrooms would be a disgrace for even a small regional airport let alone a global hub. You would be forgiven for thinking the bathroom line is for boarding a plane because it stretches across the halls. Once you reach the inside there are more sinks than toilets. 2) During peak hours people are camped out all over the floors due to the lack of seats. Sleep is impossible because of the crowds. 3) Perhaps overwhelmed by it all staff are generally friendly but unhelpful or surly and unhelpful. For far fewer flights this would be a decently modern little airport. However when crammed in with the rest of the cattle it feels like a terrible place to be. When compared to the hub airports of the other 5 star airlines on skytrax (Singapore Hong Kong Kuala Lumpur - all of which I visited in the last year) it is a joke.
Travelling with QR we have visit Doha Int Airport every year for the last 6 years. Service and conditions at the Airport is ok for us. We have no problems to find seats while waiting in transit however the toilets area I have seen better in other airports. The main issue for us is how long time it takes to go by bus from the aircraft to the airport. Our experience is from 10 to 25 minutes which is long time when the departure time is 45 minutes. This year July we didn't have to be checked arriving the airport and I have never understand why they check people who arrives in transit. We look forward to see the new Airport next year so we don't have to go by bus from aircraft to terminal.
Airport does not have enough space to handle all transit passengers. There is nowhere near enough seating and toilets. Having to queue outside the mens toilets was a new experience for me and I felt very sorry for female passengers who had longer queues outside their toilets. Avoid Doha if you possibly can.
Airport staff were very humble. The only drawback was the bus ride after exiting the aircraft until you reach the airport. It was really very tiring and hectic. A complete modern airport is much awaited where you disembark from the aircraft directly into the main airport.
Transiting through this airport at around midnight is horrifying. There is no where near enough seating and toilets. Having to queue outside mens toilets was a new experience for me and I felt very sorry for female passengers who had longer queues outside their toilets. Avoid Doha if you possibly can.
Billions spent on the new terminal but someone seriously miscalculated the number of toilets required. Security staff rude and I have doubts about their efficiency. My hand luggage was x-rayed twice notwithstanding that I was in transit and it had been done thoroughly in Milan. Curiously my person was not searched during these checks. It is difficult to see the logic. The bus journey from the aircraft seemed never ending. I thought this was supposed to end once the new terminal had opened. I could not find any water fountains/coolers.
Great network of destinations and cabin/flight crew excellent but ground staff and Doha airport simply not up to the job. Had an uncomplicated transfer through on way to Europe though lengthy bus rides standing to/from tarmac and lack of airbridge onto plane problematic for older passengers with mobility issues. Check-in in Europe for return trip went smoothly purchased some duty free goods after checking in luggage and accepted as carryon to Doha in the usual sealed plastic bag. Passed through security again into Doha airport without comment when we were bussed into the terminal for a 2 hour transit. Had difficulty accessing departure gate due to long queues. Walked around to gate lounge that appeared to also have access to correct lounge but apparently did not lengthy redirection by ground staff and instead of being 15 mins ahead of check-in for ongoing flight we were 2 minutes late gate had been closed and we were off the flight with 24 hrs to spend in Doha airport. Went to board the ongoing flight and all our duty free was confiscated as was the duty free alcohol purchases of many other passengers including transit passengers who'd purchased in Doha. Final insult was to get home nearly 48 hours after starting our trip to find our luggage had not been placed on our flight despite repeated assurances that it would be. Facilities and processes on the ground are insufficient to cope with the rapidly expanding flight schedule and staff do not have sufficient support to retain customer focus. And I would agree with other reviewers regarding minimal toilets!
On arrival (for work) after midnight on a Monday night had to wait about 2 hours to get through immigration - this considered regular traffic. On departure 3 weeks later arrived at airport early checked in and went through to find its US$40 for access to the pay-in lounge where I could get an alcoholic drink.
The Airport terminal is pleasant enough and Duty Free Prices were average. Main complaint is there are too few toilets far too few. Every toilet was packed to capacity. With the number of people moving through there they need to improve that. Also if people are lying under the pay phones to charge iPhones and laptops then make a proper charge station to accommodate these people. There are charge stations but as with the toilets it is designed for half the volume that the airport can handle. Would rather fly Emirates next time.
Transited 2 times this month at DOH airport. Crowded but fast security checks. Nice and efficient personnel at transit desk information and gates. The negative aspect is the dirty toilets!
Writing this from the Oryx lounge in Doha. Can't say much about the main terminal but as far as I could see it was packed. Oryx lounge good (costs $40 USD per person) not much food option but got good shower with towel you can borrow. Toilets and shower are cleaned every so often and were in excellent condition. Computers and WIFI internet provided free of charge even the printer is free to use! As for the food for about 18 hours I was living off Pepsi bread and butter and a mushroom soup but the staff are friendly. Oryx lounge is recommended if you got a long layover but not if your layover is under 2 hrs to 2.5 hrs.
Transiting to/from LHR and HKG. The airport is clearly in transition as the opening of NDIA approaches. The terminal is still massively overcrowded even at 0300 but it's quite easy to find a seat as seats are everywhere. The new colour-coded transfer card system works well and clearing security only takes a few minutes even when several wide-body aircraft arrive at the same time. Staff are friendly and helpful with no hassle at security. Toilets rarely stay clean for long – the cleaners work very hard but they simply can't cope with the huge volume of pax. Shops are still cheap compared to other airports especially for bottled water. The biggest issue is probably the bus ride to/from the aircraft – this must surely now be the world's longest aircraft-to-terminal bus ride – the distances are huge! Announcements are infrequent which must lead to many missed connections. Unlike some I quite like transiting here but the new airport is eagerly awaited.
We had about an hour between flights at Doha (RGN-DOH-LHR). On arrival we spent many minutes cruising round the edge of the airport in a transfer bus eventually got to the transfer gate the fast transfer lanes were closed but no queue at all at normal-speed lanes so no problem. Arrived at departure gate as it was due to open admired once again the confusing way a flight disappears from the gates display screen list as soon as the gate is opened. Our flight was delayed so we hung around for half an hour. They don't make announcements about delays over the PA because it is a 'quiet airport' (no-one told the lady who was using the PA to tell us not to smoke). Suddenly the gate was open we moved forward but great efforts were made to persuade us to sit down again to avoid an unsightly queue but we resolutely kept standing and submitted ourselves to the first of 3 back to back ID checks. Got to the gate itself (check number two) and down an escalator to a tatty ground floor area waiting for access to the transit bus two of which were parked by the doors. The escalator continued to bring more and more people down from upstairs. Still no exit was allowed to the bus. A man struggled through the crowd with a key. It didn't fit the door lock. The escalator had been turned off by now to stop people tripping over each other at the bottom. The man tried the other door. An ironic cheer went up as the door opened. Time for our third ID check and on to the bus which then didn't leave for a few minutes even though it was obvious more the one bus would be needed. We set off on another extended tour of the airport perimeter and arrived at the foot of the aircraft's steps. Naturally only the rear door was available to us Economy class passengers so boarding was slow. All in all not a brilliant experience. Hope the new terminal opens soon and is better than the current one.
Not satisfied at Doha transfer desk section service is poor. They don't have enough staff at the counter desks there were 9 counters but only 3 staff members assisting the long queue of passengers. No special/fast track counter desk for transfer passengers with only an hour allowance and who have to be assisted very quickly for an immediate transfer. As a result passengers asking for a quick assistance seem like they are begging for service with transfer desk staffs and fighting with a fellow passengers at queue jump to avoid missing the flights. Please improve your service hoping to have a very fast and smooth transfer on our next flight.
We just transited through here on our way to Amman and found the experience much less stressful than we had expected. By the time we disembarked from our first flight our next flight was already boarding but the flight attendants assured us it would be fine. The longest part was the bus ride as we flew J class to Doha and then were flying Economy to Amman so the bus first dropped the continuing J class passengers at the Premium Terminal before going to Arrivals and finally to the Transfer terminal. Once inside I was pleasantly surprised. The security check lines were moving very quickly and in about 10 minutes we were at the gate ready to board the bus.
Great airline but what a shambles at Doha it is not a pleasant experience. Flew MAN-DOH-KUL with 1.5 hrs change time outbound and 1hr 45mins return. All transfers appear to be by bus but this is very poor. The ground staff have a completely lackadaisical attitude it is 15 minutes before you can disembark then a wait on the bus while the driver chats with his mates. Elementary things like vans being parked on the bus ways delay you even further on what feels like several km from plane to terminal. We only went through security on the return journey for some reason and there were long snaking queues but the actually processing was OK. When you get to the departure hall it is not too bad with some nice outlets like Costa that take cards for small amounts for no surcharge. Not that you will get time to use them as they are calling flights for ‘immediate boarding’ 50 mins before time. None of this was in any way relaxing given the ridiculously short transfer times booked by Qatar Airlines
I transited at Doha Airport. I understand that the airport is in flux with new terminal about to be opened. What appears to be confusing at first turned out to be just fine. I had a 6 hour layover and took advantage of the quiet in Oryx Lounge for $39. For me it was a good value as I was able to take a shower have a snack at the buffet and a short nap. Waiting in the general transit terminal would haven crowded noisy and services would have been few. On my way home I had only 30 minutes to transit because my first flight arrived late. I managed to get though to layers of security with ease and board my flight on time.
The airport is small. That's what you'll notice first. Duty Free Selection is excellent. Duty Free staff are very helpful too. The eating out choices are mediocre two or three fast food joint upstairs. According to me the maximum lay over time you can spend here is 2 hrs. Unless of course you have lounge access.
Transited through twice in last week. Airport is of ok quality quite compact lots of seating but generally had over crowded feel which let down the experience. Lack of food outlets and ones available seemed full / lots of rubbish about. Main ground floor is mostly filled by large duty free shop. Problem with airport is buses from planes to/from terminal does give it the feel and look of a fancy bus station. Going to far side of runway from / to terminal takes ages (15 mins) on the bus and can stand on the bus waiting another 15 mins waiting for buses in front to let people board the plane before allowed off. Will wait to the New Doha Airport opens before every go through again.
"Doha airport is not a place to spend more than an hour in transit. Very poor facilities for longer stopovers. The bus trip from plane to terminal is not a pleasant experience as the journey can take more than 15 minutes and after a long flight the last thing you want is to ""strap hang"" in a bus which has very limited seating. I would not travel with Qatar again until it upgrades the Doha airport facilities. Even though I have travelled both business class (superb) and economy class (not much better than other airlines) I would not fly Qatar again unless the transit time is no more than one hour. Doha airport is dry (unless you can access the first and business class lounges) yet on the contrary the outbound duty free has a large range of liquor products at very good prices."
Arrived Doha en route Shanghai to Heathrow. Damaged an already inflamed Achilles tendon on stepping up to shuttle bus. On arrival at terminal an official made me sit down whilst he fetched a wheelchair. From then on it was priority treatment. Staff could not have been more kind or friendly. Had travelled out through Doha. Found terminal clean uncrowded with easy to follow signs. Speak as you find and I found them wonderful.
Other than having to travel between the aircraft and the terminal by bus I have no problems with Doha but my review is based on travelling business class but I've never had any serious problems when flying economy. The new airport should be open soon so its goodbye to the free tour of the airport by bus.
The original terminal which I used to pass through frequently in the 1990’s seems to have disappeared to be replaced with a larger more modern building which is only a temporary terminal pending opening of the new Doha Airport. There are no airbridges so passengers are bussed to and from the terminal. Many connecting flights have short transfer times (mine was 50 minutes) which considering the time needed to travel to and from the terminal makes for a rushed and somewhat stressful transfer experience. I had been given an orange and yellow trimmed ‘short transfer’ boarding pass on check in with instructions from Qatar Airways to make this visible on arrival at Doha and to follow instructions. As it turned out no one was interested and there were no ‘short transfer’ lanes open or anyone offering assistance. Fortunately it was easy enough to identify my departure gate which was only a short walk away. The terminal itself is rather basic and functional and still too small for the number of passengers using it but easy to navigate and seems to do its job effectively enough. I was also impressed that my bags made the connection but all in all not a particularly enjoyable experience.
I used this airport with my wife and kids on the way to and from Singapore to Paris flying with Qatar Airways. We did not disembark into a terminal but into buses waiting on the tarmac to bring us to the transit terminal in the middle of the night. The trips in the buses were long we were stuck in one of them for 20 minutes at the bottom of the aircraft waiting to board the aircraft the driving style of the drivers was anything but smooth. The terminal itself was drab and looked very old and tired with nothing to do in it (no duty free hardly any food outlets).
Very smooth and fast on the short transit but unpleasant and boring for 14 hours stay on my way back home through it. Freezing cold aircon late at night only three tiny coffee outlets. Two smallish food courts with very limited choice (moderately priced though). Duty free there was a total disappointment in terms of choice and prices. Toilets were clean and well stocked. Used paid lounge (Oryx) and was disappointed with selection of snacks (almost nothing to eat) quality of pastries selection of drinks. Overall the facility just does its business but nothing more. Hope the new terminal will be what Qatar Airways deserves.
It is a pity that after a great flight with Qatar Airways from CGK I have to experience a lot of discomfort from very long bus trip from the plane to the terminal limited food stalls limited rest rooms and short of seats. I do not think I will fly with Qatar Airways again although this is one of the best economy class I have ever experienced. It is hard to believe that the bus trip from the plane to the terminal or the opposite can take more than 30 minutes while most of the passenger are without seat it is very much torturing.
As a special assistance customer I was terrified of transiting Doha Airport after reading other reviews. However my experience could not have been more delightful. Upon parking at the stand myself and all other special assistance passengers were disembarked using a lift vehicle and driven in it to the transfer terminal. There we were seated in a reserved area then taken swiftly through security. I was taken to the smoking area whilst my wife checked us in and then we waited for a bus to take us to the aircraft. We again used a lift car to enter it. Super job most efficient.
"Passed though DOH to and from Asia. The transit is pretty unpleasant. All stories about the crowds and queues and bus rides are true. Security check was fast took about 10 minutes. There weren't enough areas for sitting. One quiet zone with about 40 impressive uncomfortable seats with fridge-atmosphere. Another quiet zone with more seats and a little bit warmer doesn't deserve to be named ""quiet"". Lavatories provide just warm water but are clean at least. For people in economy there should at least be a little better organization."
Travelled through this airport twice last month and overall impression was that it is below average. The biggest problem is that there are no airbridges onto the plane so in order to board the aircraft you go down an escalator into a very cramped 'holding area' with hardly any seats before boarding a bus for the very long journey out to the plane. Very poor indeed. Other facilities are quite basic with small crowded and dirty toilets and a general air of overcrowding including a horrendously long queue to get into the Oryx lounge. The only positive was that there seemed to be a lot of Qatar Airways staff all around the terminal assisting passengers. I hope the new airport will provide a much better experience for passengers.
Good points: clean bright well signposted sleep lounge for economy passengers helpful staff. Bad points: small overcrowded not many food and beverage outlets sleep lounges have funny (and uncomfortable) curved loungers. Used buses to take passengers to/from aircraft and terminal. Confusing terminal instructions for passengers debarking.
Have to agree with the earlier posts. I could find only 3 toilets in the Transit Terminal Departures Area - all simultaneously out of operation. A freezing cold terminal in the middle of the night no facilities non functioning 'information' screens and lengthy bus rides all conspire to make Doha a fairly dismal place to make a connection. Why on earth have they scheduled so many flights transiting though an airport without a properly functioning terminal? Not recommended - and a poor advertisement for Qatar Airways who are clearly trying to deliver a quality product.
I found airport to be crowded and lacking in the number of rest rooms needed for the passenger traffic. The security lines after getting off the bus seemed daunting but use of looping lines seem to lessen the chaos. There were quite a few duty free shops but food and sundry outlets non-existent. Will not transfer in Qatar until the new terminal has been in use for at least a year.
Stayed in Doha 2 nights whilst doing Rome-Singapore. No air bridges. Bus out to plane on departing flight took 30 mins. Airport itself had 1 Costa Coffee outlet past immigration to serve the whole terminal. Toilets in the terminal serving around 12 gates had 2 cubicles and a queue. Would not go back to Doha until they open the new airport.
My only experience of transiting DOH in the past was as a J class passenger and having read the reviews of the airport for transiting 'down the back' I did wonder if I had done the right thing. The flight was an hour early and there transit terminal security check was deserted so there were no bad experiences and I was soon walking around the duty free shops. Cost of food in the food outlets seemed OTT but there is nothing new in that concept! Boarding for the onward connection was orderly although making everyone use the rear steps for boarding was a pain especially as the other steps wouldn't have disturbed the J class passengers (who in fact hadn't boarded anyway). I sincerely hope that the new airport will do away with the need for bussing (which is pretty much a thing of the past at most airports). Otherwise not half as bad as I feared!
Hundreds of pushing people trying to get through two security gates queue jumpers shoving a few people nearly coming to blows and no air-conditioning. Once inside the facilities are not bad but could be better. This is my third time through the first two times were good but this last time it seems to be copying Heathrow for bad service.
Transit at Doha for SIN-MAD and BCN-SIN flights with Qatar Airways. Airport is absolute chaos. No airbridge long bus ride between plane and terminals confusing terminals unfriendly staff asking nonsense and unnecessary questions which slows down the boarding process. Very slow security clearance very limited seats. Toilets smell WIFI is almost non-existent and I don't even care to visit the duty free shops. Luckily our transit time was between 1-2 hours.
One of the strangest designs I've ever encountered. No air bridges. All aircraft are at remote stands requiring transfer buses a real pain in the summer heat. Multiple terminals (arrivals departures/transfers satellite transfer premium terminal). Departures/transfers terminal incredibly crowded even at 1 in the morning. Security lines can be long and slow. Duty free store crowded and difficult to get through. Sparse selection of magazines books and newspapers.
I have been to Doha airport a couple of times as transit passenger. The airport is quite big but if we consider the amount of traffic it's handling it should be much bigger. When busy it's really over crowded and security check might take more than an hour to pass. Duty free is small but has a good collection of products. On the bright side toilets are pretty clean food in the restaurant is nice and plenty in amount announcement is very frequent. All in all nice airport just have to be much more bigger in floor space.
Passed though DOH to and from Europe. The transit is nothing less than horrific. All stories about the chaos and queues and bus rides are true. People were already spilling out of the exit door because of the lines at the security check there was no line to speak of and it took me 40 mins to pass through. They are only using 4 of the 10-12 X-ray machines for hundreds of transiting passengers. There weren't enough areas for sitting. For people in economy there should at least be a little organization and cleanliness.
First class Premium terminal. Luxury bus picks you up from plane with 15 seats. Premium terminal has a very limited duty free. There is a games room with a few PS3's and a nanny room to look after kids as well as a business centre. First class lounge was not busy. Food was enjoyable and included sushi and fresh exotic fruits. Had a 7 hour connection so was given a twin room which gave a comfortable 4 hour sleep. Spa treatment was overpriced so avoided that. An extremely enjoyable experience.
Does not have a lot to offer except the Oryx Lounge. You can book for 25 pounds (GBP) for use of 6 hours. It has showers complimentary food and drink (alcohol served until 2am but you have to ask for it at the food counters) and free internet. It provides seating a small amount of sleeping couches and a smoking room. Staff are very friendly. Lockers are available although you need to ask for a key at reception. Great value for money and a fantastic place to relax if you have a long transit (I am currently in lounge in a 7 hour transit (12am-7am). Warning no announcements are made in the lounge so keep an eye on your watch and check the screens in the lounge for boarding gates.
Generally it is a transit/transfer airport. Compared to many other airports it is standard during peak hours you hardly can move freely in the airport. The duty free is small with limited items available. For such a transit terminal it is not entertaining/accommodating enough. The toilets need improvement but still adequate. No trolleys available so you need to carry all of your cabin luggage when shopping in the duty free and the queue of the payment point could be a nightmare. Seats are often not enough during peak hours. Since they bussed everyone upon arrival and departure it was very time consuming. Really hope the New Doha International Airport can be operational soon.
First time visiting Doha and to be honest it is not very good. There is chaos probably as a result of over- staffing. The staff members walk around arbitrarily opening and closing lines resulting in large masses of people being moving around aimlessly. The bus transfers are long. Much easier to transit through European airports. Duty free on the first floor is pretty nice and there is a smaller duty free shop on the second floor.
Been at the transit terminal only. Any bigger and it probably would've been overbearing. Wide choice of duty-free products and cafes. Seating adequate sleeping room too small. Most washrooms are decent. Free internet and notebook for use - very handy given that skype is already installed. They update you with flight information regularly on the mic as well as the display board. Security a bit too tight but that's understandable.
I live in Doha and use the airport frequently. The most common problem is the lack of seating or space for travellers. The departure queues are the least efficient but customer service is great at the counter. The problem we have experienced is knowing where to go for the check-in process but staff are very hands-on and get travellers in the right queue. Signage could be better. I never experienced any issues through security and immigration staff are wonderful. The food places located in the terminal are usually very busy with a lack of seats and there are lines for food. The currency exchange booth is generally busy. The baggage return is hot and cold. When I returned from Egypt we waited over an hour for the bags to be distributed. After an hour I went to the baggage office and complained because incoming flights after ours had received their bags. After I complained bags started to be distributed one-at-a-time. The smoking rooms are available and relatively clean with air vents. Restrooms were clean with service assistance available. The bus transits are long but usually very efficient. Cabs outside the airport are quickly available.
Had two long layovers at Doha both about 8 hours. Unfortunately we were not made aware of the Oryx lounge by our travel agent (I think we would have use it). We arrived at Doha to wait in long queues - they did however move quickly. The transfer to the terminal was very long on the 2nd leg. The transfer to the plane on the 1st leg was terrible (all shoved into a very small waiting room) and after about 20min doors were opened to allow us onto the buses - which we waited in with closed doors when we got to the plane. What is the point of a smoking room if everyone stands inside with the door open? Duty Free badly laid out on the one side - during peak times you cant move - a very strange mix of products. The food/outlets selection very limited. On the 2nd leg of our trip - we arrived at about 12pm (airport very busy) and sat down at a table - were told to move by a staff member who said he needed to clean. Roped the area off and left.
First time visiting Doha and to be honest it was not as bad as I expected from the reviews. Transit terminal has plenty of staff and is clean and functional but toilets need a good clean did not use the food or duty free shop so cannot comment. The bus transfers should be described as a free tour of the airport new airport looks impressive and I hope that it opens soon.
Transfer via Doha en route from London to Dar-Es-Salaam. The airport wasn't quite as I would have expected. No air bridges to terminal all passengers disembarked onto buses which then went for a ride around the airport only to arrive a few hundred meters from the plane some 10 mins later. Security on arrival was efficient. Terminal building overcrowded with not enough seating. Shopping limited and pricey also they would only give change in local currency. Food choice not great and badly organised (you have to queue twice first to pay and then for the food). Toilets appalling. Wifi didn't seem to work. The new terminal is due to open soon which should change the picture. Until then an airport to be avoided if possible.
Flew to Beijing through Doha. 8 hours of stopover in Doha. The facilities are insufficient the biggest problem was the insufficient dirty toilets. The terminal building for transfers is small overcrowded and messy. Transfers from planes to the terminal buildings are done with shuttle buses they do not have bridge system connecting planes directly to the terminal building.
Getting better for Economy Class transit passengers as they now have most of the x-ray machines operating and better organisation meaning queues at peak times are bearable. Security staff are friendly and helpful. The terminal is still bursting at the seams though (and will be until the new airport is built) and it is often difficult to find a seat at peak times. The free wifi works - the guy at the QTEL booth is really helpful. Food is good but there is only a limited number of outlets. All the gates are bus gates and sometimes the transit is less than slick.
I must say I was surprised after reading the reviews. They seem to have the bus to and from the aircraft well organised. Plenty of seating not much in the way of food and what was there was fairly pricey. I'm sure the opening of the new airport can't come soon enough. However the airport was not the hell hole it's made out to be.
Good clean Airport. Customs and arrivals very overcrowded but plenty of seats to relax could do with a better choice of food.
Transited through Qatar Airways Premium Terminal which is excellent. Calm airy relaxing excellent food plenty of staff boarding times announcements in good time. Only drawback is the very small and uninviting shopping outlet on the ground floor. And the long bus rides around the airport from/to the aircraft remain.
This was the third time I've been to Doha airport. The check-in area and customs clearance were overcrowded. Once airside the airport was bursting to the seems due to Qatar Airway's success. There was a lack of decent restaurants and cafe outlets (serving healthier food). The free wi-fi they advertise and I had used 2x before was now unstable and I kept getting error messages. Not much else to do and not many spare seats or relaxing areas. The fact no planes pull up to gates mean annoying bus transits. I seriously hope the new airport will be much better and for the time being would advise flying via other regional airports such as Dubai Abu Dhabi or Muscat which have far superior airports.
Bus transfer from airplane to arrivals was quite standard. Transit is channelled through a few open security desks. My transit was around 7am - peak period. Overcrowded and limited duty free space limited choice of books/newspapers restrooms not acceptable standards and very low airconditioning. Oryx lounge 40 USD for entrance is not gift but at least you have a well airconditioned space with comfortable chairs space and high speed internet. Food availability was limited - around 11am they offer lunch service yet limited. If you have more than a couple of hrs transit time using the lounge could be a good solution. Departure procedures were standard although pre boarding was very unprofessional. Pax were squeezed in a small preboarding hall for 30 minutes then moved by bus to A320. The bus stood by the aircraft for other 20 mins with door closed before disembarking us. A little co-ordination between airplane and bus services would have helped.
Very close to the city center which is nice. Immigration check-in security were very efficient and effortless when I arrived and left Doha. The Oryx lounge is good value for money ($40) in case you need to spend 2hrs+ in the terminal as there are very few shops and not much to see from the windows either. Duty free shopping not as much as in DXB but no long walking distances here either to the gates. Would compare DOH to AUH airport. Still the new Doha airport will be most welcome as a window to the world for Qatar. The first and last impressions a traveller gets is key! Even more important for transit pax.
Main terminal is way over capacity and there is not enough room for passengers with at peak times. You get a bus from the plane to the terminal and when you get to transit (the old arrivals hall) you are met with a sea of people trying to get into the terminal through security. There is supposed to be a system for short connections but the short connections line did not exist and they only call some people out of the line if their flight is closing. Tempers get frayed very quickly. Once through security if you have a short connection you need to run to your gate if you have time to kill there are not enough facilities. All this is planned to change with the new airport but at the moment Doha is a place to avoid in transit.
The sooner the new terminal is built the better. The long bus transfers from/to some flights can mean the difference between successfully making a transfer connection or not with bags or without. I did make a very tight connection to Shanghai after arriving one hour late from Barcelona only to wait on the bus at the foot of the airstairs for 15 minutes along with 5 other buses! There needs to be better coordination between the staff in the Premium terminal and those at the aircraft to enable business and first class passengers to make the most of the great transfer facilities.
I had the misfortune of booking flights late and getting poor connection times. 8 hours outbound 13 hours inbound and they are clearly well over capacity. Transfers queues were long and frantic. Inside the lounge they have tried to improve catering facilities but food was poor. Toilets were appalling. How they have had such a deterioration since my last visit is beyond me.
Coming in from Frankfurt around 1900 transfer was a nightmare for someone with tight connections. In the end it only took 45 minutes or so. Coming in from Bangkok around noon was a complete different story all security lanes open AND through in 30 seconds so we had 1 hour and 25 minutes to wait for the next plane. Outbound we had a long layover and I strongly recommend the Oryx lounge although it is a bit pricey for $40. In the general passenger area the toilets are not that clean they have an attendant in every room but since people washing themselves water is all over the place. Travel times by bus as mentioned in earlier comments are true outbound 15 mins from airplane to the terminal outbound it was just 2 minutes.
We traveled late 2010 and found our overall Doha airport experience to be terrific very pleasant and helpful staff and very clean airport. As we had a long layover we paid the $40 to use Oryx lounge this proved to be a good idea. Again good experience staff were helpful and multilingual. Food was fine and seating was ample. Even had a great floorshow provide by an angry and irrational man picking arguments with all and sundry. Perhaps he couldn't find the smoking room but the entertainment made the wait seem shorter. Would happily use Doha again.
Similar to my previous review as little has changed for transit passengers security and immigration process quite quick but this could depend on how many flights are arriving at the same time. Ground floor always seems to be crowded duty free shop poorly set out I've never been able to purchase anything here due to the long queues much better to use the smaller duty free shop on the upper floor. Plenty of seating available upstairs and as the seats have armrests it stops the backpackers lying full length still not somewhere you'd want to spend a long time. If you have along stopover there is the Oryx lounge $40 for 6 hours but before you pay check there is a Melbourne flight due to leave within the next 8 hours the rudest most inconsiderate people I've come across for a long time. All airport employees very pleasant and helpful.
Used Doha for my recent trip to India with Qatar small airport can get very crowded when multiple flights arrive but staff were pleasant and efficient and pointed to the right direction and spoke an array of different languages. Plenty of seating an okay duty free standard food court. My gripe with them is the bussing of passengers to the aircraft especially for flights for passengers for Asian destinations where the bus was overloaded and without airconditioning and waiting on the tarmac. Hopefully they will solve the problem with the New Doha Airport with airbridges.
I've used Doha 6 times since May major drawback is the bussing to and from the aircraft. Plus point is that there is ample seating. If you are flying into Doha as opposed to transiting the queues for immigration tend to be small. Duty free prices expensive service tends to be very slow. Food prices not as bad as they can be at other airports. It will be interesting to see whether they've addressed the minus points without ruining the plus points when they open the new terminal.
Visited two times during transfers. Both times no long lines quick through baggage check. From and to airplane long routes on buses. Airport is old but does for a short transfer. A smoking room available coffee shop eaterie and duty free shop (not cheap except cigarettes). Working people friendly. Overall a positive feeling but not a super airport.
About 12 hr transit journey MAN-DOH-KTM. The queues for security checks on arrival could be better: there were lots of connecting passengers with very few (and very long) lines which could be improved. Transit area was great: good range of facilities (food toilets duty free shops to look around etc.) I had a great view of the runway from where I stayed. Wi-fi throughout the waiting areas could be a huge plus.
Brief transfer en route Heathrow-Male around four hours to kill on return journey. Outbound involved boarding a bus on the far side round the perimeter road through security - seemed a bit cursory - upstairs to departure gate straight back downstairs onto bus and straight back to far side to join second plane. Easy to pass time on return plenty of seats and a great view of takeoffs and landings. This time the flights arrived and left from the terminal side. Duty-free very expensive but you don't have to use it - it's an air terminal with a few shops not a ghastly mall like Heathrow or Sydney. Piers would be nice given blistering outdoor temperatures but that's academic as a new airport is being built.
A mixed experience. Arrival very easy and quick. Departure rather stressful. Have to fight through crowds lines for check-in passport control rather confusing and disorganized as was security and not convinced how serious it was - there is secondary gate screening which is good. In the main terminal one shared lounge (except for Qatar Airways) as far as I could see and a couple of places to eat.
My family had 4 hours plus between flights so we paid $40/head to use the Oryx lounge. This covers food and drinks (including alcohol on request) WiFi and showers. Not the greatest lounge ever but very friendly staff on the reception desk and quite a useful base for a long transit time.
After reading reviews here we were slightly concerned even though it was only a 2 hour stop over. We need not have worried at all. Security was quick and easy with efficient staff who pointed us in the correct direction for transit. After our flight from LHR we wanted to freshen up and found the toilets very clean with large cubicles and plenty of paper towels. Duty free was expensive but there is a smaller shop on the 1st floor were you could buy small gifts books papers soft drinksetc at good prices. Next door was a Costa Coffee and we enjoyed a nice coffee for a similar price to Europe so we had no argument there. Didn't use the food court area but it looked okay nothing fancy and not much choice but was serving it's purpose. All in all it was an okay small airport which was very clean and comfortable my only one annoyance was the gentleman on our boarding gate who stopped nearly every non-white person who passed to check their details. He was so rude and patronising to a British born Indian lady in front of us it was embarrassing for her. Thankfully she kept her cool and dignity which showed him up. If this is normal for the male staff in Qatar then it's a real shame but something for people to be aware of.
Transiting to/from HKG. Huge queues at security due to constant landing of widebody aircraft but it never took longer than 15 minutes to clear security as plenty of staff and scanners are available. Never imagined an airport could be so crowded at 2am. The terminal is too small considering how busy this airport is becoming but this has the benefit that all the gates can be reached 2-3 minutes after security. Passports are only checked at the boarding gates. Facilities are limited (ground floor duty free area a few restaurants and small shops upstairs) so a long layover would be dull but enough for a 2-3 hour wait. Plenty of seats everywhere. Toilets inadequate - the cleaners do try but can't seem to keep up due to the volume of pax. No air bridges so a long bus journey to/from the plane seems usual. Efficient polite English-speaking staff throughout. Cheapest bottled water I have ever seen at an airport - Â£0.33 GBP! A nice place to transit if you have a short layover I will try and use DOH on future transits to Asia.
Doha airport is on the small side for the numbers of flights Qatar are running. I arrived from Manchester on route to Bangkok early evening to the usual long lines at security - which to be fair do seem to quite efficient. Main terminal is compact to say the least lower floor crowded duty free area badly set out almost impossible to walk around at time without knocking something off the displays with your bags - long queues to pay I gave up and went to the second floor which is much better with plenty of seats. As I had an eight and a half hour stopover on both outwards and return flights I pre-booked into the Onyx lounge - this is situated on the second floor and quite nice - quiet with plenty of seats a small internet corner. In the main area there are TVs newspapers and magazines but only of local interest. A small food area is nicely set out selection of food a little disappointing although its plentiful you can help yourself to tea coffee and soft drinks as often as you want. The cost in $40.00 but if you are only in Doha for a short time its not worth paying . Check in is very good in Doha as it was on all parts of the trip Qatar staff are excellent and went out of their way to book me into an exit row seat due to my height. I believe the new airport will open in 2012.
Long stopovers both ways in DOH - 5.5 and 4.5 hours. Limited choice and low quality of food and drink if you have no lounge access. Childrens play area was closed and looked in a bad state of repair. Toilets in sufficient supply but not very inviting. Boarding announcements nonstop and very loud - airport was cold buses were even colder. Bus ride and waiting time at the aircraft was unbearable on both trips. On the return leg we remained 35 minutes in front of the aircraft before being allowed onboard. As a result we saw the baggage handlers for our flight throwing violently all suitcases on the tarmac prior to loading - not what you would expect. Transfer and security were efficient. If you have a short transfer in DOH it may be okay. For longer stopovers wait until the airport has been re-vamped or take warm clothing and aspirins.
Arrived at 18.30 from Manchester to connect with a flight to Dubai. Like many others we were on a remote stand and a bus journey longer than average. However it did mean that you were dropped right by the Immigration desks and transit section. So you didn't have to walk far. Transit processing very quick and I was in the departure lounge 5 minutes after getting off the bus. Doha Airport is small which means that all the departure gates are within the same area - no walking miles. Duty free shop small size good choice of usual items but a bit chaotic due to lots of people. Prices same as other international airports. The food court was small and also chaotic - food below average so dont rely on this! Nowhere to get a beer. My lay over was only 80 minutes but this soon passed as boarding for my onward flight started 50 minutes early due to the plane being on a remote stand. The experience on the return journey was very similar. For both flights we were ready to depart well before scheduled time. Doha airport is very efficient although I wouldn't want to have to stay there for a long time as facilities are limited.
I had a stop in Doha on my way from Shanghai to Johannesburg and back. The duty free was overcrowded and toilets dirty - there was enough seating thoug. No real restaurant to sit down and have a snack or a drink (the food court was full). The airport is reaching full capacity now and I hope they will open the new Doha airport soon.
Good airport. Easy to go to check-in and moving in the airport - not too big. The bad thing is the way to go to plane using small bus that take 20min to go to the plane. The road of the bus is to go all around the airport: a bit long.
I have passed through Doha twice as a stopover to Bangkok. Doha is a great airport if you don't have too long between flights. But on my last trip the stopover was eleven hours. I found all staff very helpful and friendly yet professional. Plenty of space to sit down and relax. My one criticism (and I do realise Qatar is a Muslim country) Doha is an International airport and needs a good 'sit down' restaurant (not a take-away) and a bar for travellers. Having said that I look forward to more visits as I found Qatar Airways the best airline that I have flown with.
"I got here early as I thought my Amex Card gave me access to a lounge however only Amex issued in the Middle East can have access so found myself with 2 hours of walking round. When I arrived the queue for the baggage screening was short so was straight in checkin was fast immigration was not so fast and final security check was okay as the immigration lines were throttling the amount of people trying to get through. Once inside you go straight into the duty free area of which there were plenty of cigarettes but everything else seemed to be lacking for example the only decent champagne was a '98 Dom Perignon everything else was Moet or less. To be honest they did have everything you could want i.e. electronics Mont Blanc Hugo Boss etc but the range they had of each was limited and expensive compared to UK High Street prices. There were a few shops on the upper level but the main shopping was a large single shop on the lower level. Food was also limited no restaurants just 2 food courts at separate ends of the terminal both were very busy until gone midnight then they were almost deserted. Opposite the far food court was a small childrens play area. One thing you could find plenty of was toilets and smoking rooms however some of these are 'hidden' so most people crammed into the smaller easily accessible rooms whereas the larger rooms were empty. At the far end of the terminal were a mosque and next to it a quiet room. The quiet room has very comfy chairs but none were free so a few people were sleeping in the mosque despite the sign ""No sleeping in the mosque"". On a previous visit here I was with BA and had lounge access this makes the airport a much better place to be. Unless you have lounge access this airport is okay for short transits and if you don't have long to wait for your flight but if you are there for more than an hour you may get a little bored."
I had 1 hour 20 minutes to make a connection. You have to go through security which is the long line when you first get off bus into arrivals lounge. It will take about 20-30 minutes to get through. They were quick to get passengers through. Behind it you will find lot's of stores and boutiques. Bathrooms were clean and efficient. If you're a smoker they have a smoking room. I made my flight with 20 minutes to spare.
Used the airport 1 week ago as a part of my flight from Singapore to Athens via Doha. A small airport with all the basic facilities you would need for a short transit but if your transit time is long bring along a good book as you might not have much things to do here.
Aircraft parked remotely and everyone has to be bussed to terminal. Long line at security check but reasonably well organised. Terminal itself is rather boring and announcements too loud. Layovers tend to be long (3-5 hours). Food counters only seem to offer fast food. Coffee expensive (9GBP for 2 coffees!). Toilets overrun at certain times
Qatar Airways transit arrangements (MXP-DOH-BKK) were first class very quick (5-10 mins once your bus arrived at the terminal) and hassle free even with kids. Economy terminal is really quite nice perfectly adequate and there is a super play area for kids at gate 16.
I have passed through this airport about 20 times in the past few years I use Economy hence don't get the privilege of accessing the Premium Terminal. Transfer lines just to scan your bag can take up to 45 minutes. The transfer section needs to be thought through given the expansion of Qatar Airways. Staff are either friendly and clueless or just unfriendly. Toilets are disgusting. Very limited food and duty-free options. I'm glad that a new airport is coming up as this airport does not too Qatar Airways' reputation any justice.
Just used Doha airport to and from Cebu. Airport is very clean plenty of comfortable seating and toilets. Did not use any of the eating facilities as stay was not long. Only criticism is the chaos getting through the transfer x-rays 2000+ people desperate to get through for flights which had announced last calls more staff stopping queue jumping would have helped.
Clean small modern airport fantastic for transfers and staff are helpful. Plenty of seating space on the 1st floor but ground floor gates were crowded. Go upstairs and sit. There is a Starbucks on 1st floor at one end and accepts dollars and British pounds and the staff speak English. Change returned will be in Qatari dinars. On the other end of the floor is a restaurant but I did not use it. As someone commented below the toilets aren't as clean as the airport. But I found some clean toilets near the Starbucks hidden away - just ask the Starbucks staff for the nearest toilets. I prefer Doha Airport over Dubai because of ample space and peace and quiet and easy transfers.
Very clean airport fairly limited shops but adequate for short transfer stops. Plenty of seating. Departures can be a bit chaotic. Staff very helpful.
Since Feb 2006 I travel very often between Berlin to Karachi/Islamabad (TXL to KHI/ISB) and I find this airport very different from 2005 it has improved surprisingly. As I am privilege club member I am guest in Gold lounge which is very comfortable place to be. If I have more than half an hour between flights it is usual that I take a shower some food and tea before my next flight. This airport has all wonderful except its security screening machines where queues are very long and in summer it can be very huge.
Stopped on transit to Abu Dhabi. Small but well laid out airport with plenty of seats. Bus transfers are a pain but unavoidable at the moment. No problem with the gents toilets on my visit but my wife said the floors were wet in the ladies toilets. Overall good experience.
For our morning arrival the airport was not at all crowded. For a mother of three most important of all it held a really nice play area. The area included a climbing and sliding area which is really helpful when working off all that stored energy from a long-haul flight. Better than expected.
We flew from here for our summer holiday. The most stress free experience of an airport I have had. Car park cheap and next to the entrance. Excellent location. Staff very helpful. Very clean spacious and great facilities.
I've used the airport several times this year and on a Monday morning it's an incredibly quiet place. Generally it's not bad although we were locked into arrivals by mistake on one occasion. It's like a smaller version of Liverpool airport and suffers from the same atmosphere. Signs warning the approaching motorist of dire consequences should they not comply with a list of regulations serve as a welcome. Then one is charged to use the drop-off zone even though a few yards away you can park for free for 15 minutes. The 15-minute rule both here and in the drop-off zone adds a little extra inconvenience to the experience as it makes it difficult to be met by a partner with a car (they may be obliged to drive around the airport for a while if your plane is late). Then we are regaled inside the terminal by loud warnings about wheel-clamping. With about a dozen customers inside this seems less than helpful to the ambience.
Very disappointing treatment by arrogant security staff. Not an airport I would happily use again. Great shame for other hard working staff working there but my experience colours a disappointing experience.
Very small airport but as we arrived early we checked in and got through security very quickly. Staff arranged for us to pre-board as my son is autistic. Just 2 small shops and wetherspoons cafe/bar. Would use again.
Flew from Doncaster and planning to do so again. The airport is small and basic but to be honest we checked in late to save boredom and everything was ok. The WHSmith could do with being a little bit bigger as it can get a little crowded the Wetherspoons restaurant is probably the best feature. Basic bathroom facilities but all fit for purpose. Would be nice to see the airport expand a little but I guess that comes with more flights. Overall it was a pleasant enough experience coupled with the fact it only took us 20 mins to get home after baggage collection on return. If you can fly out of Doncaster id say support it as much as possible. Another plus about Doncaster was parking right outside the terminal major plus after any flight. They have a play area for kids which a nice touch and thoughtful never seen one of these even in the best of airports so 10 points to them. Id say Doncaster is a clean stress free airport with decent staff and a basic selection of things to do. One other plus point is that the run way is ready to take the big flights just need to wait on demand.
The airport simply cannot cope with any significant number of passengers - and I am only talking about two plane loads here. Be warned that once through security the only food outlet is a far too small Wetherspoons - and there aren't enough tables to cope with the customers let alone the frazzled bar staff trying to take food orders. Expect the queue of hungry customers to snake all round the departure lounge getting increasingly annoyed that they won't get fed in time or won't have anywhere to eat their food even if it does arrive in time before boarding.
Fantastic airport to use. Reasonably easy to find. Car parking is a joy found a space and was inside the terminal in 2 mins. Building bright and clean and all staff were pleasant and friendly including at security!. Departure lounge was roomy with a great view overlooking the runway. If shopping before a flight is your thing there is not a great deal to satisfy your needs. Both out and return flights were on time and I was out of the airport and in my car 20mins after landing. Normally use the nightmare called Leeds/Bradford where you are treated and herded like cattle most of the time.
If coming down A1 do not follow signs via M18 - this takes you miles round outskirts of Doncaster. Continue to J4 then through Bawtry much easier and less hassle. At airport no sign at first roundabout for Premium car park so got in ordinary one instead. When did find right car park it was full. Airport website says 45 mins from York - this is wildly optimistic - allow at least extra half hour.
The airport is well designed easy to navigate and hassle free once you are there. The lack of I found travelling to and from Doncaster airport a frustrating and not a particularly pleasant experience. A very out of the way place needing an expensive taxi ride from Doncaster main line station to get there. Very few shops and little to do whilst waiting for the flight. Poor refreshment area and even worse food. No walkway from the plane needing a treacherous walk across the tarmac in icy conditions Arriving from Tenerife late at night we had to queue outside in freezing conditions whist waiting to go through passport control. Many passengers had babies and young children. I certainly would not rush to use the airport again.
The airport is well designed easy to navigate and hassle free once you are there. The lack of public transport direct to Sheffield is a major flaw though. This needs to be sorted out quickly because I am aware of many people using other airports with direct links for this reason.
A very easy-to-use airport. My only complaint is that if you have any small (less than 100ml) liquids to take through in your hand luggage they charge you for a clear plastic bag out of the vending machine whereas most other airports provide them free. Beware of this and take your own clear re-sealable freezer bag.
The parking is excellent approx £7 a day is good value very close to the terminal. The building itself is light lots of glass and steel. Booking in is the usual speedy process. The departure area is spacious and easy to navigate. The issue I have is the security check when you have a couple of flights going out at the same time security can get overwhelmed and you get the feeling your going to miss your flight but you just scrape it. Rest is easy. Baggage reclaim is fast.
Doncaster airport is a half sized replica of Liverpool Airport also owned by Peel Holdings. On the whole the airport is spacious not crowded and pleasant staff. Check in generally quick as is baggage reclaim. Passport control on return can take a while as usually only two officials are allocated to checking passports. Two things to beware of - if you have a flight in the evening buy sandwiches before going through security as quite often Wetherspoons airside will close as early as 5.00 pm leaving only one bar open with a very limited selection of snacks. Secondly be very careful about using credit cards in the parking payment machines in the airport. I used my credit card to pay for 15 mins parking which should have cost 3 pounds when the credit card bill arrived the machine had charged me over 300 pounds! This apparently was due to a fault on the machine but it took several months and threats of going to the press to recover it all. Despite these minor flaws Doncaster Sheffield airport is a pleasant under-used provincial airport which although a little isolated is a pleasant change from the crowds of Heathrow or Gatwick.
Spacious and efficient terminal with good cafes bars & shopsthough the lack of a cashpoint that doesn't charge an extra fee is disappointing. Main problem though is onward transport. Unless a direct bus or train route to Sheffield is created soon they really should remove the city name from the airport.
What a pleasant experience this airport is. Flight departed around lunchtime on monday loads of seats in departure lounge free no queues in Duty Free or at bar! Although Leeds /Bradford is my local airport the terminal there is struggling to cope with increased passenger levels. I would fly from DSA in the future.
Flew to Pisa with Ryanair. Flight takes off early morning and the airport was empty at that time (07:30) we were the only people checking in beats Manchester and foggy Leeds Bradford. Nice and small no car park shuttle bus rubbish. Car park easy to navigate short walk to the terminal few check in desks - not hard to find yours thoroughly pleasant.
Must add that the public transport links are not the best. Currently the only public transport is a shuttle bus to Doncaster station from where you need to take the train if you want to go to Sheffield. The fastest train is 15 mins but others take around 35. There are also taxis at the airport although a taxi into Sheffield will be around 35 pounds. They can be difficult to come by at night.
Very easy new airport to use. I have so far used it four times in it's opening year. It's pretty much an exact replica of Liverpool John Lennon Airport and is spacious and well laid out. Going through the airport couldn't be simpler or easier. Staff are pleasant and are always visible and approachable. There is a great landside bar which has a full view of the airfield. Baggage reclaim takes 10-15 minutes at the most as there are not too many flights at the airport at the moment.
Finally the new terminal is in operation. Arrival and departure were a breeze no queues no trouble with signage nothing to complain about. Toilets are clean overall facility is still under final touches of construction. The terminal is too big for the amount of flights served so very few people there. Pity they have no food and drink outlets landside yet and just a small stall with snacks airside. Overall impression very good everything worked there and up to the international standards. From plane to taxi in 5 minutes from check in to plane in 10. Good.
"Arrived from Kiev rather late in evening. This airport is still very Soviet in many ways eg. it has very bad apron and terminal lighting and baggage claim is directly from luggage carts which can cause confusion if two flights arrive simultaneously (but don't worry the friendly airport security guys are there to help screaming at you in Russian when they suspect you walk toward the wrong cart). Other facilities also seem very basic and/or outdated and there is absolutely no information about transport to the city centre (not even a timetable!) so you may unfortunately find the unofficial ""taxi"" drivers your only alternative for going downtown. To be honest one of them gave me a very fair price and even gave me change upon arrival but I do not recommend ""inexperienced"" travellers to use these guys! All in all I found the city's rail station a much more civilized place than the airport."
Small and easy to reach and navigate. Lots of parking space which is reasonably priced. Food and drink opportunities mediocre especially airside. Paying one euro for the shuttlebus to the parking lots is ridiculous. Time consuming when everybody has to purchase a ticket on a full bus. Paying for Internet (€3/hour) is a rip-off since most airports offer free wifi. But all in all a good airport.
Small airport with short ways. Sometimes there can be queues. but there's everything you need restaurants cafe enough check-in desks visitors terrace for free and several travel agencies. The airport shuttles from the next train stations could be cheaper or free.
Small and nice airport located close to Dortmund. However if like short ways and fast service this airport will convince you.
Great airport I hope too many other travellers don't discover it for a while. Have used DTM a few times in the last year and it's quick and easy to use for both arrivals and departures. Security is very quick with lots of staff on hand and although airside facilities are a little limited it's not an issue as you don't need to spend much time there. Arriving is a breeze I'm always off the plane and leaving with my luggage within 10-15 mins. If only other airports were as efficient and pleasant to use.
As mentioned below a functional regional airport. appears very new. compared to UK airports underused. Fairly quick passport control and luggage already out on the belt meaning out of the airport in less than 15 minutes after getting off the plane. Flying out found the viewing deck (found by chance) was good apart from the lack of aircraft flying to view! Airside there is not much and what is there is hidden if you turn left after security go to the end of hall and turn left there is a bar/cafe area and duty free place. If your turn right at security for easyjet flights there is a tiny dutyfree shop and further along past passport checks a tiny stand selling coffee and drinks. All in all a good functional airport.
Nice small to medium sized airport serving low cost airlines. Travelled through Dortmund airport while on route from England to Poland over Christmas and New Year. Arrived with Easyjet and had to check in for a Wizzair flight. 2 Hours difference between arrivals and departure times. Arrived cleared passport control picked up luggage checked in for next flight cleared security and was at departure gate all inside of 40 minutes! Fantastic. Return through Dortmund was just as pleasant. Facilities are good enough for short stays and there is a nice quiet cafe on the arrivals floor. Not bad at all.
Decent airport serving as one of Easyjet's German hubs as mentioned before. In addition services to most major hubs and cities on offer. Strong in Polish flights with several cities direct on offer. Terminal facilities adequate terminal modern and appropriate for current passenger figures. Future may require terminal expansion.
"DTM is now gaining a higher profile as easyJet's northern German hub. DTM can be compared directly with easyJet's UK counterpart - Luton (LTN). Both can be described as ""engineers' airports"". There is an absence of architectural flourishes and each is strictly functional. DTM in fact does a good job at present although pressure points may build up as traffic levels increase e.g. at the airside bar area. The Dortmund Flughaven website omits any mention of public transport connections to the city. There are two options. A dedicated express bus service to the Hauptbahnhof costs EUR5 one-way and takes some 20-25 minutes. It is generally an hourly service although there is a two-hour gap between 15.30 and 17.30 on the return Hauptbahnhof-Flughaven timetable. An alternative way is to take the free shuttle bus to the nearby Holzwickede DB station from where there is a circuitous twice-hourly service to Hauptbahnof. The one-way fare is EUR 1.80. End-to-end journey time is around 25-30 minutes."
I flew into Douala on Swiss and departed on Virgin Nigeria. Both experiences were quite pleasant. I had only hand luggage and was in and out of the airport quite quickly. When departing we waited at the gate which was quite calm and cool. Yes its a bit manic as you walk out of the airport with people and noise everywhere but lots of places are like that. If you know where you are going or have someone to meet you its fine.
Not much has changed in this airport built a 30+ years ago. The outside is decrepit. Security is virtually non existent. Touts were able to penetrate the immigration arrival area where apparently for a fee they assist arriving passengers with the immigration forms. I witnessed this with a group of Chinese arrivals. More touts swarm you in the baggage arrival area where you are also hustled to part with cash in order that they may assist you through customs. Everybodys luggage is supposed to be searched before exit but I think this is more of a money grab. The whole experience can be very unsettling to the western traveller. Exit was not much better. The airport staff often try to extort money for hand luggage with limits set at 7kg. A small bribe will get you past this nuisance. I forgot to pay airport tax before getting to the immigration counter so the immigration officer graciously offered to collect it for me. From my hands it went straight to her left pocket! Duty free is rather limited. A few arts and crafts stands some selling local music cds/ dvds local tea coffee and some snacks. An airport to avoid even by African standards. Security screening is performed by the airlines themselves. The only place where I was not hassled by money was in the toilet. No way I can foresee the FAA approving direct flights to the US from this airport.
Pleasant and unmemorable for all the right reasons - no excessive queues no overcrowding just a good efficient airport doing what airports are meant to do ie. processing passengers swiftly and without hassle in an attractive environment. Some parts of DRS particularly the LH check in reminded me of a smaller version of HAM. I agree with Mr Evans that DRS is under-utilised although at least that means there is plenty of space for everyone.
Little expense has been spared to make DRS a spacious and state-of-the- art. An all-round highly agreeable experience with the added advantage of DRS being very close to the city centre. A half-hourly rail service connects DRS with Dresden Hautbahnof (a 25-minute journey) with several intermediate stops all for a princely EUR 1.80 one-way fare. BA has recently launched an LGW-DRS service (great views of the heart of the city on the landing approach from the starboard side) but the airport remains somewhat under-utilised.
"Every time I travel through Dubai it gets worse. They don't have Wifi anymore, there is only Boingo, which offers 30 minutes (sometimes 60) of free Wifi but in 9 out of 10 times it breaks after about 5 minutes, telling you you have already used up your minutes. If you purchase more, you frequently have to re-login which requires you to check your email, but you have no internet to do that, so your purchase is useless. The newest invention is a security theater for transit passengers to make sure you didn't purchase a bomb or gun in a duty-free shop on your incoming flight. This leads to long queues where you can spend more than an hour, so if your stopover is less than two hours, don't even bother to go to a lounge or anything."
A transit airport so one would expect a lot of travelers lounging and sleeping. There's too many passengers transiting between Asia and Europe so there's not enough seats to go around. Airport staff were helpful but not friendly (would not go the extra mile and sometimes seem unapproachable). Not many facilities other than some F&B and shopping outlets. Wifi not working - I was kicked out of the service every few minute or so - probably due to overcrowding at the airport.
"Travelling with a children at this airport is a complete nightmare, in particular transfers from one terminal to another, and or attempting to collect bags and exit the airport. It's just too big, heavily congested, and difficult to navigate. The terminals are so far apart, a transfer from Terminal 1 to Terminal 3 can take anything from 30 to 60 minutes depending on crowds and boarding gates. The arrivals hall to pass through customs took us 1 hour 50 minutes, that was on top of the 30 minute hike by foot and metro rail just to get there. I normally use the Emirates lounge facilities, however had the misfortune to use the public toilets inside the terminal, it was an absolute disgrace. I won't go into the details, but the floors looked like a herd of camels had relieved themselves on the floor. General airport cleanliness was below standard for such a new modern airport, but in fairness, given how many people utilise the airport facilities it would be a nightmare to try and keep clean. Duty free shopping is very expensive when compared to similar large airports throughout the world."
"I was transfering there in Feb and arrived an departed in July. Dubai is very modern and clean airport. Terminal 3 was  where I was traveling. It is huge, maybe even too big. I was very upset with ""duty free"" prices. I asked myself few times if I`m really hungry. Fortunately I was given a free-meal coupon due to few-hour overstay. I read lots of satisfied opinions about this airport, so I expected a lot. Maybe that was a mistake. It is high-standard, but nothing was really outstanding, just good quality."
"It was a 7 hour transit and they had only 4-5 charging stations which were completely occupied. After hours I found myself a spot to charge my devices but then came the next trouble where the wifi connectivity was so bad and it took several minutes just to log in! After completing my work in sometime I went through the duty free shops which had the usual stuff with no big price difference than other airports. The number of restaurants are good but if you want still want to find out more options you must switch terminals to look for some more restaurants which is really tiring. The only good thing is that staff are friendly to assist, but the infrastructure and the facilities must be developed."
"I flew in 4 times to this airport within the last 2 weeks, 3 arrivals and 1 departure. Flew in to Terminal 1 where all the other airlines land at. Now this is a review for Terminal 1. This greatly varies to Terminal 3, where all the Emirates flight flies into (which is the posher terminal). Absolutely amazed at how bad the condition of the terminal is, considering this is a main hub for tourists and that this is Dubai. My flight from Muscat to Dubai was only 45-50 minutes long however the queue at the immigration? 1 hour 10 minutes - longer than my flight. The immigration was jam packed. Regardless the day or the time! I flew in on a Thursday afternoon (4pm): Packed. I flew in on a Monday morning (11am): Packed. I flew back in on Wednesday (12am): Packed. Oh and not to mention, it was boiling! I don't know if the staff noticed just how packed it was, but they certainly did not notice just how the amount of people equals to more body heat. Considering that is is Dubai, they can honestly do better. Because of all these queuing, I have decided to only fly to Abu Dhabi whenever I need to get to UAE again (unless I'm flying via Emirates)."
"I was in transit at Dubai this time. No more impressed with the airport than I was last time. Wifi is incredibly slow, not enough toilets and the shops are overpriced and boring. A long three hour wait there with limited internet access. Smarten up your act if you want to be an international hub."
"Everyone gets excited about going through Dubai. But I shall never do this again. First and foremost, the flakiest wifi ever. I could not get any connection all night. I wanted to talk to my family but with calling cards I had to spend at least 30 dollars. That too I had to exchange my USD to local money first. Ground staff were very unresponsive and not willing to help. I travel frequently but this time I made a terrible mistake choosing Dubai for my connecting flight. All said, never again."
Very long queues for check in immigration and security. The staff had no idea how to arrange the people. I actually felt unsafe because it felt as though there was going to be a crush there. This is the worst I have ever seen Dubai T1.
It's been a long time since I last had to transit through Dubai and the trauma of trying to rush through and not miss our connecting flight is almost a distant memory and I hoped as we were flying to stay in Dubai it would be less irksome this time. Whilst the queuing was not too bad staff were certainly not friendly at immigration either in or out. The facilities in terminal 1 were limited and there was hardly any seating for once we had checked in our return flight. However the main problem was that everything was filthy. The toilets smelt and were extremely hot. The floor was sopping wet due to the shower heads in the loos. Even the few seats available in the terminal were dirty I perched on the edge they were so bad. I would have sat in Costa or Starbucks but they were small hemmed in and packed with other disconsolate souls looking for a seat. Couldn't access the wifi either and power sockets were no where to be found. Duty free was expensive and not well laid out. Lots of construction work going on seemed to have to walk for miles. It seems to me the infrastructure and staff attitude are not up to it Dubai just isn't a mature enough destination to act as a truly international hub.
For any future travellers - do not expect to purchase breakfast at the airport. Extremely difficult to get a cup of decent coffee and even more difficult to find a place to serve breakfast. We had to make do with a greasy burger and a soda! For an international airport not to have decent restaurants in their departure lounge is appalling in this day and age. Eat before you arrive!
"Immigration at Terminal 1 is one of the worst experiences one can have. Before the ""regulated"" queues start there are people backing up in an uncontrolled crowd. Same situation when going through immigration when you leave Dubai. Everything else is just ok."
"Twice a year I am flying into Dubai International Airport Terminal 3 and things are getting worse. The queues at immigration seem to grow and the immigration officials are getting more indifferent every time I land at the airport. They take their time and spend more time chatting with colleagues and in mobile telephone conversations than in stamping passports. Most of the time a simple good morning or even a friendly nod is to much to ask for. Incoming flights are getting delayed by the endless circles planes have to make over the Persian Gulf before finally being able to land and outgoing flights are regularly delayed by 30 to 60 minutes even if everyone is onboard and the doors are shut. The message from the captain is always the same: ""Due to the fact that it is an extremely busy time air traffic control has asked us to wait because there is no space on the runway."" This doesn't change no matter what time of day you are flying. Emirates must be the most delayed airliner in the world. There is clearly a capacity problem at Dubai International leading to massive delays every time. I love to fly Emirates especially the A-380 but if this problem isn't solved I will choose another company for my future travels just to avoid Dubai International Airport."
Can describe DXB in one word - dreadful. Business class passenger transiting from LHR to SIN and the whole experience was appalling with transit taking almost 2.5 hours. Staff surly and quite frankly useless. First time flying Emirates and will be the last despite faultless service on both legs of the journey but I simply could not tolerate the DXB experience any time soon.
I fly to/from DXB regularly. The queues at immigration are the longest and worst regulated I have seen and I visited over 50 countries. I currently hold an e-gate pass to avoid this problem but before than that I had to wait an average of 2-3h every time I arrived to Dubai. Sometimes the staff modify the queues and people that arrived hours after you pass in front of you and you can't speak with them as they are inattentive and rude. The immigration officers are extremely relaxed and not concerned abut the situation and several times I have seen them using their cell phones while they work.
Terrible passport control services in Teminal-1. We waited almost 1.5 hours to pass through the passport control. They simply make people suffer. We travelled to HK and Tokyo before arriving to Dubai. There were more passengers at those airports but finished passport control so quickly but Dubai airport is simply miserable. I think they just focus on improving Terminal 3 for Emirates Airlines but ignore Terminal 1 and 2 which are in a bad condition. Our luggage belt was not known when we got out we just found our luggage on the floor somewhere near luggage bands. Outside the building was worse. Lots of people but a very narrow sidewalk - big mess!
All in all the best parts are the shopping and the Emirates Lounges. The worst parts are the wait at immigration the long walks from the gates to the baggage hall and the signage hassle when you need to change your ticket.
Airport was not to be compared with the 5 star airports like Hong Kong or Singapore. You get 30 minutes of free wifi yet if you clear your cache memory of your device you get another 30 minutes and so I had 7 hours of internet. It takes 1 minute to register not so difficult. It was adequate for transfer.
Agree with some comments here - avoid transit of less than 2 hours like the plague - it's stressful at the best of times. Singapore to Dubai / Manchester in middle of night (when I think it is busiest at DXB) stacked then 20 mins on buses to terminal - don't sit at back of A380 otherwise you will be on 4th or 5th bus (if you are economy) long queue for further security train to other side of terminal - generally leaves you with 15 minutes spare. For a huge airport toilets are lacking with big queues - top tip go onboard before getting off and avoid that situation. Seats lacking - tip is sit on floor or pay for lounge. Other than that folks it's ok for breaking up journey for East to west west to East with good range of flights going in for that reason I will keep using.
Please activate the Fast Track cards. They are pointless to have if you don't have separate Fast Track queues. The queues are a mess. We were lucky to have enough time between transfers else we would have been scrambling to catch our connecting flight. What's the point in being a Gold Member of Emirates?
Both in and out of Dubai airport we had to circle for over half an hour due to heavy traffic making for a very concerning rush to catch our ongoing flight we also had to be bussed to the far outskirts of the concourse to catch our flight home to the UK. It appears that the airport is not able to cope with all the additional flights as a result as Dubai becoming the hub airport for several airlines such as Qantas. I will try to avoid it in the future.
My fourth transit through Dubai with Emirates and it may well be my last - masses of people trying to get through security and only 2 stations operating. Emirates hands business class passengers a fast track card but the airport doesn't operate such a facility. No one around to enforce the lines for the stations people pushing from all directions resulting in chaos. Will try Qatar/Doha next time and otherwise resort to Changi again.
Terribly disappointed by Dubai Terminal 1. Very old and worn out dirty and generally a mess. Staff were rude and didn't seem to care really. Most of the staff we encountered didn't even speak English. This is a truly international airport so English speaking staff would be appreciated. Boarding the airplanes was pretty hectic announcements virtually non-existent and the signage was somehow confusing. It's a shame that Emirates (and Qantas) are the only airplanes flying from T3 since it's the only well-maintained terminal on the airport. T1 was everywhere under renovation so I hope it's going to be better in time.
The best thing Emirates could do to get better feedback is give people a longer transit time so they can relax for at least a half hour before a connecting flight. That means 2-2.5 hrs between landing and departing as it is you have to almost run to get your flight (not good). Better signage for transit passengers they all seem to funnel down a narrow passage. To be a world leader the snags need to be sorted. Apart from that no time to browse the duty free shops that won't make any money if people rush past.
Have been to Dubai many times over a 10 yr period and have noticed the changes although it is nice and sparkling it lacks friendliness the staff are unapproachable they look the other way I was on the 380 from Manchester in business class had the fast tax card but was not directed to the fast tax queue. I ended up in the arrival queue and had my passport stamped and found I was in the street only to realise I had made a silly mistake I had to now go back in and have my passport re-stamped. Had the passport official noticed I was in transit he could have easily have explained I was in the wrong queue. Once again if the staff were trained to be customer aware and to look out for jet lagged customers then perhaps Emirates will retain their market share. I will be going back to my old airline Singapore airlines who are trained in customer service.
My wife my friends and I used to love buying in the duty free shops but the last 18 months of travelling through this airport as been a nightmare 3 years ago I required the use of wheelchair assistance and service was great I would be wheeled to duty free and collected about 20 mins before takeoff and taken to the Gate I could do shopping eat and drink 18 months ago you were wheeled to a cafe for 30 mins and collected and taken to a gate toilet area (no wheelchair) and collected 5 mins before boarding and boarded last so I had to stand and struggle to my seat when people are sorting out bags etc at their seats. Staff did not care.
We had a stopover on our way back from Singapore with Emirates in the middle of the night. The airport was busy with nowhere to sit unless you wanted to pay for a drink or meal. I ended up sitting on the floor whilst waiting to go through to the departure lounge. I didn't want to go through to the 'holding pen' too soon as I guessed that there would be no facilities other than perhaps a loo and I was right. I realise that seats don't earn a revenue for the airport but I am 60 years old and had just endured an 8 hour flight with another 7 hours ahead of me so just wanted to sit quietly at 3am but it was not to be. Seem to think its a good airport as we stopped in DXB on way out but not if you are in transit. I was also pulled aside and swabs taken with no word of explanation don't know what that was all about.
Very disappointed. I'm an airport and aircraft enthusiast and was looking forward to visiting Dubai international. First of all transfers we parked on the desert and had to wait ten minutes for the bus for business and first about 6 people went on the first bus - disgraceful! My wife and I with three baby's under three then waited for further ten minutes for the next bus we then had to carry three baby's five hand luggage down steps to a bus that was like being sardines the ride took twenty minutes to next terminal. After exit we looked for the complimentary prams told they were in the airport we walked for fifteen to twenty minutes with crying baby's until we found one pram. After finding our gate I took my son to the bathroom and it was awful.
We transferred on a flight both to and from UK. On the incoming flight we arrived at the 380 terminal and it was a short walk to the next gate in the same concourse. Going through security both times was very fast we had fast track cards but really didn't need them the security staff were not very friendly but not a problem. It is very large but in this area well sign-posted the lounges are located next to each gate which is very convenient. On the return flight we had to go from B concourse to A this meant using the train this took less than 5 mins the lounges in this area are not well sign-posted and we were given wrong directions by the information desk! Again the gate is located next to the lounge the lounges are well equipped with snacks and drinks. For us an uneventful transit but I can understand if an incoming flight is delayed then to get to the next gate would be stressful to make it on time. The shops are as any international airport good for window shopping!
I've been travelling through DXB a dozen times a year for about 10 years now. Given the amount of money spent on it it's not a great airport compared to the likes of Singapore Hong Kong or Seoul. It may look bling but it doesn't work as well as it looks. Short connections of anything less than 2 hours should be avoided. Transit security has not improved at all in recent years. Emirates increasing use of A380's on the routes I fly has reduced the amount of bussing from remote stands which is good. Other than tobacco and alcohol the Duty Free shopping is not especially cheap and I rarely bother now. I don't like the Emirates Business Lounges which have about as much atmosphere as a car wash. It breaks the journey from Europe to Asia but it's not the airport it should have been.
I have transited through DXB twice in the last couple of weeks travelling on Emirates in Business Class. My main impression is that is just far too big and impersonal as if they have tried too hard to do to much and it just doesn't work. Some of the signs are very confusing. You seem to have to walk a very long way between gates particularly if you are moving from A gates to the far end of the B gates. If your incoming flight parks on a remote stand - as mine did - your transit time can be very long. On the plus side the Emirates lounges are good - if you get the time to enjoy them. No doubt the duty free shopping is also good - if you get the time to do any. I was disappointed by Emirates and the DXB experience just increased my disappointment. Hopefully next time it will be back to Qatar via Doha or Singapore via Singapore.
"Emirates fight from HKG to MAD via DXB. Very long immigration queues. No signal of the e-immigration system although we had information on the system in the flight and also included with our boarding passes. Restrooms were not as clean as in Madrid or Hong Kong and with queues. Wifi: it is 30 minutes free but really does not work properly as 20 of the free-offered wifi are needed for the registration in the system. Specially compared to HKIA it is ridiculous. All in this airport is very time-requesting so any transfer in DXB should be taken with an extra time schedule. Shopping area is impressive with big spaces but prices are generally not as convenient as in other places. There are a bunch of brands lacking there. Finally it was printed on our boarding cards that the gates were opening at 6.40 when we arrived to the gate it appeared as ""final call"". Although the materials of the airport are good although the shops are 24 hour open it has been always a sour experience."
A pretty awful experience from the 35 minute coach ride to the security queues to enter from Airside to the signage being poor half of the passengers slumped over the chairs in an authentic sub-continent way. The queues for the toilets being 10 minutes long and horrible. Expensive and slow food out lets.
Wifi only available for 30 minutes. Even that is hard to connect and when you eventually do get connected then the reception keeps dropping. Dubai should work on providing free Wifi all other major and smaller airports do.
A complete nightmare for passengers. You can fly one the best A380 but the airport is a complete mess. Fly for 9 hours and then made to sit on the floor to wait for the connecting flights. Gate B and C always seem to be in renovation but there is not enough room to accommodate passengers. The current setup is not functional.
Clean efficient welcoming and well laid out terminal buildings along with friendly and helpful staff made for a completely stress free experience. My connection time of 2 1/2 hours was more than sufficient arrived at terminal A and departed from terminal B using an airport train which appeared to run every few minutes and was well signposted and easy to navigate. The Emirates business lounge was a little small compared to some lounges at other airports I've used but didn't feel cramped or crowded and staff were attentive and friendly without being intrusive or overbearing. One of the nicest airports I've used over the years and thankfully quite a different experience to some of the other reviews I've read. I'd happily transit through Dubai again in the future.
Had to change planes on way back from Australia. If you have a tight connection time the size of the airport can be a problem we were an hour late arriving from Melbourne and the A380 couldn't get in to the dedicated terminal. This meant a frantic dash up and down several escalators and on the train were one of last people on the plane.
Not a good airport to transit through. Terminal 3 is far too small for the number of passengers using it. Hoards of people make it seem like a trip to the shopping mall at Christmas. We had a 20-minute bus journey to the terminal as our 777 parked at a remote gate in the cargo terminal. We had 2 hours 20 minutes for the connections - allow this as a minimum any less and you may miss your connecting flight. Dubai could learn a thing or two from Singapore Changi if they want to become world class.
"There are a lot of negative comments here and I am not sure how they have arisen. I've been through Dubai airport literally a hundred times over the last seven years and never had any long queues at immigration and never seen a sub-bar bathroom. Pretty good bars and restaurants - far superior to most ""Western"" airports and enjoyed astounding Business lounges when someone else was paying. Have always been impressed by the spacious public areas. Compared to the tacky dirtiness and suffocating spaces in airports like JFK or Heathrow. I hear Terminal 2 is not as good as 1 and 3 so it might be that. My impression is that it's a better airport than Abu Dhabi though the latter has a nice new terminal now."
Arrived on A380 from Amsterdam over 2 hours late because of on the one hand late departure from AMS and on the other hand being put in a holding pattern for an hour. That would have left still one hour for my transit to Bangkok but I hadn't counted on being parked 25 minutes by bus away from the terminal building. Imagine 500 people to be bussed to the terminal. Even though I was in the second bus out by the time I passed security and could start looking for my connecting flight the gate was closed. Queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed transit desk followed. So I spend the next nearly 7 hours in the airport lounges - my 'new' flight departed one hour late too due to - as was announced by the Captain - the backlog of flights resulting from that night's problems. By the way: signage could do with an improvement as well. This was my first trip through Dubai otherwise always go through Singapore and that seems to be the (much) better choice.
I had about 3h 30 min as a transit passenger. I had flown in from Amsterdam and was due on a flight to Delhi in the busy morning hours. Our flight literally parked at the fence it took us a good half an hour to reach the terminal in buses (complemented by long queues and a stuffed bus compartment). At the terminal we were subjected to long queues for security but finally when I did manage to reach the duty free it was so expensive that I missed shopping in my Dutch hometown. The terminal is huge but I did manage to reach my gate smoothly. The food is just expensive. One chicken burger meal at the Burger King was 10 dollars and the staff were rude. Overall an average experience and I fly mostly out of Delhi which is the mother of rudeness for local passengers.
Changed in middle of night from Manchester bound for Perth. Was led to believe there was direct access from the lounge to plane not so and had to go back down to the main concourse. Lounge was fine otherwise airport huge with expensive shops.
Nice but too big. OK if flying with Emirates on the A380 which are parked at gates. Very inconvenient and uncomfortable if flying with the B777 which most of the time are parked at remote locations which means long (20 to 40 minutes) transfers by bus between planes and the terminal building. This is exhausting after (or before long haul flights). I recommend avoiding transit in Dubai unless flying on A380. This regrettable because Emirates is quite a good airline.
Still struggling to get to world standard. Widespread delays despite crystal clear weather in Dubai and Europe shows they still have poor organisation. Terminal 3 is OK for transit except for certain faults like broken toilets and staff that only show up to open extra transit security when half the passengers have already arrived. They now limit free wifi to 30min - since it's incredibly slow and flight delays are frequent this is a token effort.
I was taken aback by the aggression and rudeness of the customs official I encountered at Terminal 3 on 2 October 2014. There was a lot of needless angry shouting. Next time I travel to Europe I'll transit through Singapore or give one of the other Gulf countries a try. The unbelievable rudeness of Dubai Airport's customs and security staff has driven away my tourist dollars.
Dubai is one of the wealthiest places in the world. Why don't they spend that money on a fit-for-purpose airport? Waiting to board our A380 which can carry 500+ people we had to sit in the waiting area with seats for just 100 or so and then wait again at the gate with roughly the same number of seats. Ridiculous! The nearby loos had huge queues not helped by having only two urinals in the gents and some squat toilets in the ladies which no one wanted to use. Information was very poor. We were transferring between flights but on entering the terminal there were directions to areas A B and C but no indicator board to tell us which gate or even area our flight went from. We eventually found an electronic screen where we could enter our flight details to tell us the gate - but it failed to recognise our flight or destination. Overall pretty pathetic.
Pretty appalling flew Emirates and bussed to and from planes. Easy to get lost. Check in and immigration are chaotic with too many people arriving far too early for flights. Transfer area full of Arab and African men. Long lines for men's toilets. Gaudy and expensive duty free. Nearly missed a few flights and baggage always took ages.
Went with 2 kids 2 and under. Given this airport staff extremely helpful put us in shortest queues. Both times from gate to exit door via immigration was about 15 mins total.
Beautiful and huge structure doesn't make an airport excellent. The quality of service and staff attitude makes it excellent. To be honest Dubai airport terminal 1 2 or 3 has really poor customer service and immigration counters are the worst in world. Attitude of people on immigration counter and information/management is not welcoming. They are very slow and really need to improve.
Appalling service. We were shunted from place to place by officious looking over-made up staff. There were also staff in blue shirts who would shout at one where to go. I felt disrespected. No-one could even tell us where the toilet was. There were extremely long bus drives to the plane in hot buses (in one the air-conditioning broke down) - we were not told that it would take so long and because the windows are tinted you cannot look out. There was no communication from the bus driver or the airport about the length of this trip to the plane otherwise I would have insisted on taking some water (as it is one is not allowed water in hand luggage). I have spoken to other people since returning and they have had similar experiences at Dubai. I cannot believe that people can tolerate this - it was beyond awful.
"Terminal 3 Emirates. Having used DXB on many occasions as a transit passenger I decided to spend a few days in Dubai having come in from Seoul South Korea. Its a long flight from Incheon-Seoul to Dubai of about 11 hours. The thought of another 8 hour flight right back to Glasgow was not that appealing. I would like to emphasis that ""terminal 3"" is operated totally by Emirates. After leaving my taxi I moved into terminal 3. On finding my bearings I went to the appropriate check-in queue for my flight. The check-in line was one massive long queue with about 400-500 people. This number is accurate as I stood in line for about an hour and didn't actually move. So I had plenty of time to count the people more than once. To my complete horror Emirates had 5 check-in desks opened for this number of passengers. After an hour of standing in line people were becoming a bit fed up and beginning to complain (myself included). After about one hour 30 minutes Emirates then announced that another 5 check-ins had been opened to deal with the ""large"" number of people. The only problem was they the new check-ins were in another ""building"". This involved being asked to follow a supervisor who ran us out of the terminal across a busy road into another building then a 10 minute walk to the new check-ins. When I finally arrived I got checked-in for my flight to Glasgow after about 25 minutes. I still had the joy of the assault course and long walk back to terminal 3 to go through immigration and security. Arriving back at terminal 3 I had a seat to get my breath back as I also have limited mobility. On looking at my boarding pass I noticed that I had been allocated the wrong seat. As an Emirates frequent flier I can select and book my preferred seat at no extra cost. The seat I was allocated was not my normal seat I had booked. I was now even more annoyed. The flight itself was excellent but arriving back in Glasgow was a pleasure. This experience with Emirates is one that I hope never to repeat. I have flown Emirates many many times but always as a transit passenger. Deciding to spend some time in Emirates ""home - Dubai"" was a complete mistake. Dubai itself was very interesting and enjoyable. However my Emirates experience from check-in to wheels up was a total disaster to say the least."
"I have travelled through DXB on a few occasions and always found it a good experience. When arriving through terminal 3 as a transit passenger you are greeted by lots of shops and places to eat once you come up the escalator. This area tends to be pretty busy so my first priority is usually to find a seat in a quieter area as I have a slight mobility issue (hip replacements). If you move towards the departure gates next to the windows you will find a very different world. It tends to be much quieter with lots of seating so you can relax. My second task is to locate my boarding gate just so I know where it is. Please remember that terminal 3 is a massive building and it takes about 20 minutes to walk from one end to the other. The escalator will bring you up more or less at the midway point. Great choice of places to eat and unlike the UK/Europe they tend to be reasonably priced. I got a nice hot sandwich and a 500ml bottle of water for about £4. Duty free has to be the cheapest in the world the prices are excellent. If you do have limited mobility I would suggest you move to the boarding gates area. Here you will find an electronic walkway that goes along the entire length of the terminal. It makes covering the distance so much easier. For those that are needing a nicotine fix there are two smoking rooms located at each end of terminal 3 departures. I would have no hesitation in recommending DXB as a transit airport as each time I have used it the experience has been positive. Using Dubai as a non transit passenger and going through the standard check-in process with Emirates at their ""HOME DUBAI"" was very different experience and needs another review. DXB as an ""AIRPORT"" is just superb."
Was transiting through T1. It's a huge terminal with excellent facilities. Lot's of shops food courts and facilities. Wi fi was not that strong. However there were long queues and frequent delays. We were left waiting for 3 hours as our flight kept on getting delayed.
Every flight on my trip was delayed here in and outbound and also coming from there into Gatwick. Unless you're in business and can access the lounges Dubai is a pretty poor experience. Bland costly food crowded toilets terrible showers with no place to put your clothes and bags except on the wet floor no charging points for devices except on the walls away from seats or in Starbucks and Costas (under one of the seats). It looks like Dubai has sucked up the world's airline traffic and then done nothing to support the travelling experience except provide cascades of overpriced 'duty free'.
In transit Terminal 3. Huge airport with lots of shops food courts and facilities though wifi does not work. Significant improvement for security check the past 2 years good signage but still there may be a long walk to reach your gate. However 2 big and persistent problems: the long and uncomfortable 20 to 25 mn bus drive from the airplanes to the terminal at the arrival and the regular 30 to an hour delays of departing flight.
Easy transfer through security. Long walk/journey to the new terminal A. But easy signage and plenty of staff to help. Departure lounges inadequate for a full 380 and seating uncomfortable. Surprised that business first and economy all in same area. Thought they had designed for first and business to have separate entrance direct from lounge. Could have done better with layout but good information and controlled boarding with helpful staff.
Dubai - Male 22nd February 2014 Flight EK0652. Four hour Emirates flight which took 42 hours. Only food vouchers offered blankets not supplied when requested even for children extremely limited number of seats which you can sleep on. Extremely cold during the night. Terrible communication if you get a delay - I mean zero communication! I never want to go through this airport again! Airport staff seem unable to help with delays.
Immigration lines very long. it took over an hour on arrival although immigration staff very efficient and polite. Everything else excellent.
Lots of helpful staff everywhere simple and easy-to-follow signage lot of clean toilets plenty of seating areas and a plethora of appetizing food. The Departure immigration takes hardly 5 minutes while the arrival immigration takes about 5 to 15 minutes. Faster Immigration than many other airports around the world. Largest Duty Free in the world. Smooth connection between Terminal 1 and 3 and their respective concourses. Terminal 3 the newly built terminal is an incredibly massive terminal. It is very spacious and is equipped with ultra-modern facilities and services. E-gates enable residents of UAE to complete immigration within 60 seconds. The airport has direct connection to both metro and road (taxi car and Bus) networks.
LGW-DXB-BKK round trip Emirates all flights. My connections were 2 hrs 45 mins and 2 hrs 20 mins respectively. I made the connecting flight on both occasions - but only just. The outbound leg was late in and parking at a remote stand followed by a 25 minute bus drive and ridiculously slow transit security meant that my connecting flight was at Final Call by the time I set foot in the departure hall. A mad dash to the gate and on the flight as it was closing. The return leg was a similar story but at least the A380's seem to be able to park at gates but with touching down 1 hour late and Emirates requiring you to be at your Departure Gate 45 minutes before Departure time the whole thing gets very frantic compounded with bussing and terminal transfers. A few years ago a 1.5 hour connection was OK in DXB - not any more. 2.5 hour minimum and 3+ hours to be comfortable. Terminal Transfers and Security are NOT good and the extreme amount of bussing inflicted on Emirates just turns the whole thing into a very stressful connection compared to Abu Dhabi or Bahrain. Less of a journey more of a sport.
Our youngest son was stationed in Dubai with the RAF and we decided to fly with Emirates stop for a short time before flying to UK and Europe. It was in our view absolutely awful. The treatment of passengers from business class and tourist class by customs was appalling. We travelled business class but were treated in Dubai Customs like a couple of criminals. After a wonderful time in the UK and Europe we had to go through Dubai again to get back home to Australia. We had a repeat performance of our first stopover!
I was expecting great things. Yep I got great things upon arrival over one hour in immigration queue agents were stopping and taking breaks with no relief agent. When they went on break one agent would handle two lines. How about one line for queue? That way when someone has a problem they do not hold up the rest of the line. You have to walk forever upon arrival and departure. I cannot believe they are building it bigger as it is already too big for transiting travel. I will do my best to never have to go through Dubai again. Worst airport I have visited.
New airport terminal 3 or A is famous. Spacious a good choice of shops and cafes. Reasonable prices. Enough clean toilets drinking water suppliers and seats at the waiting area and gates area. Short queuing times for boarding Airbus 380 economy passengers. Arrival transit passengers must pass security checks. Flexible airport staff which opened additional gates on request. Terminal 2 or B and terminal 1 or C are older. A little crowded with a lot of passengers but shops cafes restaurants and toilets are well equipped and clean with a good choice. Airport staff are polite give good assistance and we felt very comfortable. There is a fast subway airport train to the terminals. The gates for boarding open very early.
I transfer here on a monthly basis on my way back and forth to south-east Asia. Aircraft come in waves and during peak hours the terminal gets really crowded. Then restroom facilities tend to be messy despite regular maintenance. Outside of business lounges and the Heineken lounge there is practically never a working wifi because the system seems to be overloaded constantly. This is a real nuisance. Transfer between gates is relatively fast and easy. Neither shopping nor food is exceptional. If connecting through Dubai was not by far the fastest route for me I would avoid this airport.
My first stopover in Dubai travelling between Australia and UK using Qantas. Dubai airport compares unfavourably to Singapore where Qantas used to stop on the Australia - UK route. The airport appears gleaming and modern from the outside but once you get inside problems are apparent. I couldn't find any internet terminals. There was no working Wifi. The food outlets are extremely expensive. The toilets were disgusting and absolutely filthy. Based on this experience I think I'll fly another airline and avoid Dubai altogether in future.
No USB or universal chargers on the airport Hardly any carpeted area. Outlets on the walls are only for Middle East pins for computers or cell phones. WiFi is easily overwhelmed and practically not working.
There was a storm in Dubai on 22/02/2014 and all flights in had to be delayed with a large number of passengers arriving in Dubai missing their connecting flights to other parts of the world and being stranded at the airport. Emirates seemed totally unprepared for this event and there were long queues to get tickets rebooked. I had to queue for 2.5 hours to get mine rebooked and was told the earliest available flight to my destination would be the next day meaning that I had to spend a day at the airport. Couldn't afford to stay the night at the airport hotel which costs a staggering USD $250 at the low end. Dubai Airport is a really bad place to get stranded. The many seats did not allow you to lay down and have nap since they have static metallic arm rests that cannot be raised. The lounge style chairs scattered around are taken up pretty quickly sometimes by selfish people who use these lounge chairs to put their baggage on. This airport is typically always crowded and the number of toilets available for that volume of passengers is disproportionately small. Internet connection was very patchy with the network struggling to support the large volume if passengers trying to connect there's paid high speed connections made available as an alternative for passengers. All in all a poor place to be.
Really modern airport. It was very clean and the lounges exceeded expectations. The staff were very kind and helpful and the signage didn't confuse at all. The food is great. I didn't have to wait because there weren't many queues. The duty free is world class and one of the best airports I have been to.
Generally I find DXB to be a good airport. Overnight in the Terminal Hotel once which was good. However they can improve by addressing the following: long queues at immigration not enough toilets food ridiculously expensive.
Massive airport but as a transit passenger I found it to be well sign-posted and had little difficulty in finding my gates and appropriate airport lounge. Overall extremely clean but was very busy both times I was in transit. My only adverse comments were a) when we arrived from Sydney no air-bridge was available so we had to catch a bus to the arrivals hall. This bus trip took some 20 minutes. After a long flight the last thing people want is to get on a bus - to me this cheapens the experience and is not a good look for a relatively new airport and b) I found the entire airport to be overly commercialised - just too many shops and I think there could have been a few more places for people to be seated.
This is definitely the worst airport I have visited in the last 10 years. Noisy crowded bad signage inadequate lighting to name but a few reasons. The toilets were the worst I have seen anywhere in Asia. Most of the duty free shops seem to be owned by one company and are expensive.
Went through Dubai Airport en route to Australia. Agree with so many negative reviews. Unfriendly staff shops full of high priced items. The worst part though were the ladies toilets I queued for 25 minutes the toilet rolls were locked in to their dispenser and impossible to retrieve the sink fittings were cheap and nasty all in all I would never go back there. It certainly made me see London Airport s in a new light so much friendlier.
Utterly appalling. I feel sorry for Emirates as the airline has gone to great efforts to make a first-rate airline with excellent service and great planes. Unfortunately they have Dubai as their hub. While the airport is clean and modern the attitude of staff and the customs process are to be avoided at all costs in future. I travelled to Europe and back over a month transiting via DXB both times and both times customs queue was a very long frustrating wait watching white-robed functionaries chat away instead of processing the passengers in their queues. The disregard for the passengers made me very annoyed especially when no regard was paid to the plight of parents with small children at the end of 22 hours of travelling. I will never travel via DXB again and that unfortunately will mean I cannot fly Emirates.
Extremely large airport with great range of duty free. Very clean and tidy airport. Signage system was also good and boarding into flights was also easy. Connecting between terminals was also easy. I only had a few concerns the first was that the queues were very long the second the staff were a bit rude and thirdly the Mosque was overcrowded but at an overall excellent and my favourite airport.
I don't like Dubai Airport too much. During a stop-over you are trying to kill time perhaps score a bite in one of the overcrowded food places. Often these places are full with litter as the staff cannot keep pace with the plethora of visitors. In general too few places to sit kill time and even for airport standards over priced. And besides shopping for ostentatious items there's very little quality in terms of entertainment to be found at that airport. But it gets even worse when you enter Dubai. I went to Dubai twice in 2008 and 2013 and the customs on both occasions took over an hour which is absolutely ridiculous.
Flew into DXB International (T1 with BA) 27 November. No complaints - expected a bit of a wait through Immigration and not too bothered by it as in the end not that long. Luggage also not unduly delayed. Flew out of T1 on BA108 Sunday 8 Dec - was actually pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was. OK - the ground floor is now a retail shopping area but there were plenty of seats upstairs. My wife is a very occasional smoker and even the smoking lounge was relatively nice. Quick and easy bag drop security not unduly long winded so all in all a pleasant experience. Much more so than 4 years ago on our last visit. Maybe when the Al Makhtoum International comes fully on stream things will be even better.
Got to be the worst airport compared to numerous other airports I have used throughout the world. Overcrowded with narrow aisles and unfriendly officials. Hate to use this airport and will do my very best to choose anywhere else. If you can avoid using this airport then you would be wise too.
I used to like this airport. Now I find it overcrowded expensive duty-free shopping & restaurants and the most unpleasant immigration staff you will ever find who couldn't care less about the extremely long queues perhaps they were on a go slow.
One would expect a major longhaul hub to have sufficient toilet and bathroom facilities. These are sadly lacking at DXB. Toilets are far and few between and when you do eventually find one they are exceptionally small. Expect a queue even at the men's. I don't usually pay much attention to toilets at airports but the scarcity and poor quality of this basic facility at what is billed as one of the world's most modern and state of the art airports was glaring.
In transit between DXB and GLA. Incoming A380 arrived at Concourse B
Flew flydubai into Dubai Terminal 2. Queues in immigration hall extended back to the door. Poor queuing system (separate queue for each desk rather than 1 large queue - some queues served by 2 desks others only 1) means some pax wait much longer than others. Waited 1 hour 37 mins to reach immigration officer. Duty Free shop was so small and busy we decided not to use it. Baggage is all scanned as you exit the airport - there was only 1 scanner operating for all passengers - badly organised and chaotic. The queue for taxis was at least 1 hour long. There are no transfer services to Terminal 1 and the Metro. The Terminal is served by a couple of public bus routes but there is no information on the bus timings or routes. No arrival information service to help. Work is obviously ongoing at the Terminal which may address these issues in the future - for now I recommend you avoid this Terminal.
Dubai International Airport has become one of the busiest hubs this means very long transfers between terminals and the signage is not very clear. If you ask one of the many staff members they will direct you. The airport is clean has a wide range of shopping options. However I find it too crowded at times and the waiting at immigration is too long. I like the efficiency of the security checkpoints.
"Feb 2013. The immigration staff attitude is appalling. They are meant to be intimidating that can be understood but chit-chatting with fellow colleagues totally oblivious to the very long lines is rude. The assistant officers are rude. Asked an assistant about which line to go to for immigration (as the signage is pointing to another lane) got a simple finger-pointing answer. As the answer is not similar to the signage asked again about it get a harsh brush of ""you listen to me"". Nice modern infrastructure with barbaric soft skill."
Emirates. Lot of shops but no trolleys available and you need to keep searching to get one. Very lengthy airport so be cautious to check your gate rather than spend a lot of time running from one gate to another especially when Emirates make last minute changes. I stayed for one night in the airport hotel as my next flight was early morning the hotel staff were not courteous at all no gestures no welcome. Some gates are very remote and no shops in those areas.
Over the last few months I've used all 3 terminals for both arrival and departure except for departure from Terminal 1. DXB is a fairly good airport without being in the same league as Incheon or Changi it compares favourably with many regional competitors particularly Doha. Terminal 3 - the dedicated Emirates terminal - is the best of the three. It's modern bright and airy. Shopping facilities are generally good I've always found immigration to be relatively quick and customs is straightforward. Terminal 1 immigration queues look much longer
Terminal 1. Good airport. The car rentals section are spaced out very well and minimum disruption. Quite a walk from the flight to the immigration but that's what happens in a developed airport. Very clean.
Usually transit through Dubai on the way to the far east and often don't find it an easy experience. This time Dubai was the final destination. Pleasantly surprised. 30 mins after plane doors opened at an airbridge we were through immigration had collected our luggage passed customs and were out of the terminal. On our return check at the dedicated emirates business desks and security was quick smooth and painless. Terminal 3 and the business lounge was quiet on both journeys 07.30 and 13.00 by Dubai standards which was probably the main reason. Will be passing through Dubai in another month lets hope that our transit experience is as pleasant.
In transit between GLA and MEL/AKL. Was here in the mid-morning the airport felt quite empty compared with the times I have used it in the past. Concourse A has in my judgement helped a lot by providing the capacity which the airport needed
A soulless sterile (except for the toilets) chasm of elevators and luxury-brand shops. Not enough bathrooms fairly dirty and about 100 degrees inside them. Not enough places to sit. The contrast between Emirates' aircraft and in-flight service - which are great - and this hole could not be more stark.
This review relates to the Emirates / Qantas Terminal 3. This consists of two separate concourses Aâand B connected by an underground train. Despite the massive expansion at Dubai Airport there are still insufficient gates at the terminal at peak hours meaning that some flights park on stand necessitating a long bus transfer to the terminal. Security checks on transiting passengers can be slow. The terminal itself is basically a huge shopping mall with airbridges attached but is otherwise modern clean and attractive. The terminal is very busy but despite what others have said I found plentiful seating although there are insufficient toilets. The individual concourses are easy to navigate but transfers between the concourses require a descent underground via a series of escalators to reach the train that shuttles between the terminals where rather brusque staff bark orders and organize you into queues. Same in reverse when you disembark the train at the other end. Once you reach your departure gate there is at least free wi-fi available albeit only with a moderate strength signal. If you're lucky enough as a transit passenger for your flights to arrive and depart from airbridges within the same concourse then it can be a quick and painless transfer but if you get caught up with bus transfers from remote stands and having to travel between concourses then what might otherwise be a comfortable 2 hour connection becomes a nerve wracking experience.
In August 2013 I transited through T3 Dubai Airport from Johannesburg to the UK and back. My connections were 2hrs on the way their and 4hrs on the way back. Queues at transit security moved quite fast. Used the train from terminal A to B easy to use and very efficient. Airport is very clean well sign aged no problems to get to my departures gates.
"An ""over large"" unfriendly airport. Very surly officials slow inefficient processing. Speed queues have not yet arrived in Dubai. Fortunately we were at a quiet time. Lots of overprices shops insufficient toilets and seating areas. A visit to Changi would be beneficial."
I pass through this airport three times a year on the same route. In recent years it has got better. Queues are shorter for transit security for example. However you step off the plane and know you are going on a mystery tour. Up and sown endless escalators utterly confusing signs and massive overcrowding. Getting off the plane we were faced with signs to transit going in two totally opposite directions more than once. One of them led us into a blank corridor. The trains from one part of the terminal A to B or C or the reverse are very efficient. But until you get to the train you have no idea which bit you are in! Perhaps because of the confused layout there are a lot of staff available to help if you are stuck which is good. Some duty free options are great value but like anywhere else you have to beware because many items are not cheaper.
Great facilities and good shopping. Staff everywhere to help.
What more can you say about DXB that hasn't already been said? It's bursting at the seems and the DFS are laid out in such a way that it sees everyone assembled in the only main corridor that runs the length of the terminal! I got bogged down just trying to navigate my trolley around the place. The immigration and security lines took nearly 1hr with so many empty counters and only 5 staff doing passport checks. Dubai is busiest in the early morning and the evening so you'd think it'd be geared with more staff but that isn't the case. Whenever I fly via DXB I always enter with a sense of dread and accomplishment when I get out of there in one piece. Then new facility for the A380 is fantastic but also crowded though I didn't experience it so much as I was using the lounge but sure enough the lounges were bursting at the seems too. Dubai Airport needs to stop building long narrow tubes and start building wide malls like the massive shopping malls in the city.
I travelled to Dubai last 3 month. Airport was clean the ground staff very helpful. I was pleasantly surprised. The airport was very well sign-posted. The security lines were quite short the personnel manning these were very pleasant and helpful. The bathrooms were extremely clean and the food stalls had lots of interesting things. I highly recommended.
Flew DUS-DUB-CCU with Emirates. First flight landed an hour late but still had 70 min for the next connection. However all hopes of getting the next flight was dashed when we were taken on a slow 35 min ride in a bus around the airport to reach the terminal. The lady at the connecting terminal was extremely rude. Was booked in a hotel. The immigration was the worse I have experienced so far staff are more interested in chatting with each other rather than getting your papers done. I did not expect such a lack of professionalism by immigration staff. The airport is big but is made with the aim of making money. There are more shops than places to sit. I found many people sitting on the floor. Avoid Dubai airport. That is sad since the airline (emirates) is quite nice.
Flying from Australia to Ukraine with 1st leg via Emirates (landing at Terminal 3) transferring to Terminal 2 for flight from Dubai to Kyiv. What a mess to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2 with no assistance in English to explain or help how to get there. You have to find this minibus which is packed hoping that they will let you in. I'm a pensioner so this was pathetic. At Terminal 2 it was like a refugee camp not an airport terminal. All passengers were trying to get to their gate.
Having experienced transiting through Dubai airport 4 times since Qantas hooked up with Emirates I am most disappointed. The place is noisy overcrowded and the staff rude and unhelpful. It is affronting to go through security as soon as you get off your plane while it refuels - chaos at security with officials shouting and shoving. No time to get to the business lounge after queuing for 20 mins to get through security and then seeing huge queues simply to get into the Business Lounge. And the ladies toilets! Queues are ridiculous. Given the length of the journey Australia - London this ought to be a chance to stretch ones legs and relax a bit in the lounge. No chance! I yearn for the relaxed experience of Singapore airport transit!
One short connection (2hrs) one long connection (7hrs). The 2 hr connection is just about undoable. Still lots of bussing going on to/from remote stands - frantic dash to the gate. Transit Security is perfunctory at best - the staff weren't even looking at the monitors so why bother? On the 7 hour connection I looked for one of these sleeper seat things - dreadfully uncomfortable and the horrible booming sound system in the terminal makes napping almost impossible. Dubai Airport looks the business but when you look beneath the shiny metal and marble it's a pretty poor airport with little consideration for passenger comfort.
After all the hype from Qantas which is now code-sharing with Emirates it was very disappointing. Had hoped to check out the Duty Free for our return trip from London but the turnaround time was spent in a queue on another trip through security. Why is there not a transit lounge for short re-fuelling turnarounds? A transit lounge with toilets and coffee would be the sensible thing in the middle of the gruelling London/Australia trip. We also found the security/check in staff intimidating superior and the use of a lot of hand-waving and curt gestures didn't sit well. The terminal was very clean but it took ages lugging all our flight luggage to find a toilet. To buy a cup of coffee one needed to change money a nuisance when in transit for such a short time.
Very large. Can take 30 minutes to travel between gates. no view of outside. lots of expensive shopping if you can afford it. Arrogant staff in restaurants/shops. Efficient though.
Clearly Dubai International has been planned as a gigantic money spinner rather than a facility for passengers. The strong emphasis is on duty free shopping so glitzy shops dominate the concourses. It is easier to buy a watch than to find a toilet. There are certainly not enough of them to serve the massive number of passengers. Also the disembarkation and bussing to terminal from my Hamburg-Singapore Emirates flight was primitive to say the least. It added to weariness after a long flight. My main complaint though concerns the total lack of free drinking water in the entire airport. Instead you must convert money into dinars or try to use your credit card to buy a bottle of water. This can only be described as a huge inconvenience for thirsty passengers. In future I'll be using Singapore Airlines and fly through Changi. A pity because the flight itself and the quality of the aircraft were very good.
Used DXB Intl last week for departure and arrival I understand it can be a nightmare for those who don't live in Dubai specially in the morning my flight was at 8.30am which is the busiest time of the day. Thankfully did online check in however still had to queue for luggage drop off which wasn't very long the line to enter passport control was endless but used e-gate. Had some time to spend in the massive duty free and to have breakfast it feels like a massive shopping mall at the busiest hour of the weekend clean spotless toilets though busy. On the way back was hassle free 4 minutes from the plane touching down until the door was open aircraft parked at the new concourse A which is dedicated to Emirates A380 planes. Had to take the underground train to passport control and after another 4 minutes I was at the belt waiting for my luggage which took a bit of time. Massive clean arrivals hall nice decent duty free and money exchange facilities the only concern is the taxi lines specially at night it was endless long queue. I understand that Dubai airport would be very frustrating for those who are not living in Dubai and don't have the e-gate but I find it the most modern clean airport.
Emirates are scheduling tighter and tighter connections through DXB. 1 hr 20 mins is simply not doable with traffic delays in the early mornings bussing from remote stands chronically slow transit security rail connections between terminals horrendous walking distances to remote gates and a requirement by Emirates to be at the gate 30 minutes before departure - it's just not possible. Transiting though DXB a few years ago just involved long walks now it's an exhausting and highly stressful undertaking which in future I shall endeavour to avoid by choosing another airline. If Emirates were handling livestock instead of passengers they'd probably lose their licence.
I have transited through DXB several times with Emirates in the last 5 years. The airport is generally clean and well laid out during the most part of they day however past mid night it does become quite busy which results in aircraft having to park far from the terminal bus travel long queues at security and practically no space to sit and toilets are choc-a-block. The most annoying part of travelling through Dubai is probably the rude and unprofessional staff they have manning their duty free shops lounges and security gates. I often make use of the emirates business class lounge while travelling and almost every time I have had to encounter rude staff who make passengers feel unwelcome. After 5 years of having Emirates as my airline of choice I have now moved over to Singapore Airlines & Changi as the transit hub. Emirates is a great airline and its a pity that all the effort put into building the great brand gets tarnished as a result of rude ground staff.
Dubai is a massive airport and it takes a long time to get from one end to the other. The airport is very crowded with bodies lying everywhere in the main passageways. More seating areas are needed away from the main passageways. Toilets and showers are inadequate for the volume of passengers using the airport. When in transit the security procedure after getting off your plane is frustrating and can be very time-consuming after a long and tiring flight. It always seems difficult to find trolleys for carrying hand baggage. For transit passengers the trolleys need to be located after the security check. Many of my friends in New Zealand avoid Dubai preferring to fly via Singapore (Changi Airport) which seems to be spotlessly clean well organised and with friendly and helpful assistants.
I come in and out of Dubai T3 often and my experience thru customs is always the same - utter misery. Why don't they have the common sense to create queues for EU visitors only who can go thru far quicker than most Asians who have all sorts of issues with paperwork etc?
I have experienced T3 as most other reviewers. I agree that it is very crowded. However I must say the worst thing for me was the unhelpful unpleasant unfriendly and unprofessional attitude of the local staff. This was particularly frustrating as meaningful signage is hard to come by and one has to rely for directions from the airport staff. I have travelled a fair bit but have not experienced such lack of care towards travellers anywhere else. It was a very disappointing experience for me. Like most others I liked Emirates but would try to avoid Dubai as a transit destination in the future.
I flew last week from and to Dubai Airport T3 with Emirates flights leaving in a morning flight were airport was so crowded as most of flights to Europe leave at the same time however I benefit from the online check in and e-gate so didn't have to queue for check-in or for passport control as always love to scroll around the airport and a lot of choices in the huge duty free options. On the arrival also arrived at midnight which is a very busy period for most flights arrive around same time plane parked in T1 and we had to walk all the way inside the terminal to T3 for the passport control also long queues for passport control but I have my e- gate I pity those who don't have it. Luggage wasn't late at all well organized taxi queue which didn't take more than 5 minutes and I live in the Dubai marina side which is far from the airport however I was at home just after 1 hour from the plane landed.
On arrival the brand new automatic passport gates did not work and every passenger in the queue with me was rejected from the gate (roughly 40 people with European passports). The queue to see the immigration officer was not too bad - about 15 minutes but they clearly have teething issues with this system. On departure the passport control hall was filled to capacity at 8am in the morning and despite every desk being in operation it took one hour to get through control. Totally unacceptable service and Emirates Airlines must be spitting teeth about this experience. Never mind the airport retailers who lost an hour of shopping trade as a result. Commercially it makes no sense.
The terminal is clearly nowhere near big enough to handle the volume of passengers passing through. This seems bizarre considering it is relatively new and Dubai's reputation for building big! It always seems hectic and overcrowded even at 2 or 3 in the morning. There is a general shortage of restaurants and bars and seating is limited at those available. Shopping is also limited and expensive. One plus point is that it is possible to sleep on the lounge seats between gates if you can find an empty one. Take your blanket off your flight if you are transiting and have a long lay over.
Used Terminal 2 because of my FlyDubai flight. I was shocked the terminal doesn't represent Dubai well. I arrived on an early morning flight everything went smoothly. I would recommend for those travelling through terminal 2 it is not the best place to stay for long time.
Arrived from Dublin to Dubai airport near midnight on business class. The signs were all over the place send you to turn left then turn right all it needed to say was keep going straight. The airport is very badly air conditioned with temperatures near 28 deg c. A nice 24 deg c would be suffice if you are trying to save energy. When we got to customs there was a huge line even though we had business class tickets. We ended waiting 40 minute in line to clear customs. The only bonus is that at least our bags were ready at the carousel as it took so long. Business class all had chauffeurs to drive you to your hotel. Had to wait another 15 min for this. All in all in took 1 hr 30min to leave the airport to the time we touch down. It's not really world class is it?
Long lines and the outside of terminal 1 is total chaos. Always crowed and one runway is always shut down. Horrible place to land takeoff or transit. I have been an airline captain for 33 years and never seen such incompetent management at an airport of this size. Daily nightmare of long waits insufficient toilets rude and surly employees.
On arrival we had a one hour wait at customs passport control (with infant). 19 Feb 2013 - Flight from LHR - EK008. On departure Emirates flight to Durban. (21 Feb 2013). The terminal experience was not good. After clearing passport control there was nowhere to sit and very limited shops to explore in the terminal.
Although good to break a longer journey I would avoid this airport at all costs if you have an alternative! The staff are rude and very slow at security/immigration but worst of all is the shortage of toilet facilities. Not so much a shortage as such but the people who use them spend ages in them and long queues build up. This even occurs in the business class area!
Just through the new A380 terminal in Dubai which opened fully a couple of weeks ago. Really good idea having the Business Class Lounge as a linked series of lounges grouped to the Gates. So we arrived in to the terminal and walked through the general concourse of shops easily found the signs to follow to find the Business Class Lounge which is on the top floor. Once admitted to the Lounge the thing is to go to your Gate Number and use the lounge area there. You can wander all over and sit anywhere you like but it makes sense to park yourself near your departure gate. Boarding then is easy just put down the champagne glass (in my case!) and go through to the lift which takes you down 3 floors to your aircraft door. The lounge is well set out well appointed good shower rooms (for women can't say about the men) and a series of hot and cold food and drink counters throughout. Very comfortable chairs the usual magazines etc (happy to find a locally printed copy of The Australian). I like the concept and the execution of it. At last a lounge big enough to take the volume of passengers going through in comfort. Well decorated. Staff were the most helpful and friendliest I have encountered even to helping me lift my cabin bag onto the belt for inspection. Happy to use Dubai as my hub.
My Air india flight landed at 4 pm after some 15 minutes of walking I reached passport control. There are around 34 counters for it. I was disappointed to see even though there were so many counters not all were functioning those who were functioning were really at a snail's space - even the queue management was terrible. There is one counter for one queue and three counters for another - we were in a queue with 15 people in front of us that immigration officer took 2.5 hours to process them. Duty free at departure terminal 1 seems limited. I think most duty free shops are in terminal 3. Later I was told that passengers arriving on late night flights face more problems at immigration. I will try and avoid it even for transit.
We flew to Dubai on January 31st 2013 from London Gatwick and faced long queues at passport controls a 2 hour wait. Many desks were not open although there did seem to be staff wandering around doing nothing - why couldn't they have helped? The staff were extremely slow taking at least 5-10 minutes with each person they were extremely unfriendly and obviously have no idea whatsoever about customer care. This really did spoil the start of our holiday we were using Dubai as a stopover for a couple of days. These queues were totally unacceptable and I doubt whether we would ever use Dubai as a stopover again!
Passed through terminal 1 on 8th Feb long walk to Immigration where there was already a queue and only 3 desks open why don't they operate a single feeder queue. Seemed like it was going to take ages to get through there was no sense of urgency but we did get through within 30mins. Dubai is another City where for some reason they scan your hand luggage. The arrivals hall has a very small waiting area and meeter's/greeters are not allowed inside so the only way is to go out and stand around. On the way back we encountered another slow moving Immigration queue. Terminal 1 generally looks old and tired shops in departures have a limited range of goods. Nothing special.
Generally a good airport though rather uneven very good in certain aspects and with serious shortcomings in others. At one end if you fly Emirates on business this is a fantastic airport with huge lounges minimal or non-existent lines for check-in immigration and boarding. At the other extreme if you are using Terminal 2 you are stuck in a small crowded space with a couple of restaurants not entirely clean bathrooms and a very long transfer from other terminals in minibuses with space so limited that you cannot even stow carry-on luggage. Most experiences in Terminals 1 & 3 fall somewhere in between. Excellent shops and a wide range of restaurants but not much space to sit if you just want to wait for your flight without spending money.
Wednesday January 23. I spent 13 hours trying to get a connection flight out that day. No staff available to explain what was going on except that many planes were left in the air or grounded because of fog. Rumour had it that their whole ticket booking system had crashed so their ability to give new tickets to the hundreds of passengers who had missed flights was minimal. People arriving from long flights were arriving and standing in lines that weren't moving and were unsupervised no water no food no information no assistance. Lines were vague and people started yelling. I was in a line for 6 hours and when I got close to the counter the employee left the line with no replacement. I had already been on two long flights from Los Angeles before I got there. You had to walk a long way to find food no directions and you would loose your space in the line. Waited in new lines for another 6 hours and the same thing happened. At about 10.30 that night I found British Airways in another terminal who gave me food and water in their lounge and quickly found me a flight to where I was going and I left a few hours later.
Excellent airport for departures but a nightmare or arrivals because of immigration indeed. Especially frustrating because some lines move 3x faster than other lines. Better do as in the US airports: one queue only but being serviced by multiple desks. Easy to implement and would already make a big difference. Still need to train immigration staff.
I would imagine especially immigration would have done something about the long queues and long hours (1 hour) in my case. To get an eye scan then collect your suitcase on arrival is a nightmare departure is overcrowded and immigration staff take too long with one passenger (5 minutes at one time I noticed) and can stop to chat even when it's noticeable that only 3 counters are open and they have too many passengers waiting. Dubai Airport needs reoriented staff.
The following issues were encountered. 1) 2 hours to get through immigration. 2) Immigration staff talking to each other throughout the processing of entry. 3) After leaving immigration a poor standard of security screening with officers not looking at the scanning outcomes again engaged in discussion. It was a farce. Could not be described as an efficient airport or workforce.
This is the second time I've travelled through Dubai and hopefully the last. My main complaint is that immigration takes absolutely forever (1 hour +). They never have enough desks open and the queues move so slowly because the staff spend so long with each passenger. It's very chaotic with everyone getting impatient and stressed and then desperately running to new desks when they are opened. Departure is much smoother though although the airport does feel quite crowded all the time.
Immigration takes two to five minutes to process each passenger why? Lengthy queues that take ages no organisation. Gates are miles away. Emirates staff seem disinterested.
Unfriendly staff at Emirates terminal horrible queues without any organization totally crowded airport and business lounges without any silent room or corner. At the gates almost no seating possibility. Small amount of finger docks long bus transfer times to and from the terminal and airplane up to 25 minutes.
Arrived in Dubai airport after midnight to face a human congestion at the immigration where counter staff took their time to chat with one another. Upon leaving terminal 3 with its rows of spanking new but empty counters only 3 counters were open. For our two families the counter staff decided to split us all up citing full flight although we were checking in at 2200 for our 0300 flight. Only on our insistence to see the seating plan did they give us seats together. Half of the passengers had not checked in yet then. It was our first and will be our last time we will use Dubai if we can help it. Duty-free is also bogus. More expensive than most airports.
The single most important priority of any large building besides safety is circulation and effective signage. The current Dubai airport fails miserably on both counts. The building is obviously planned and executed outside in rather than inside out with many baffling transfer signages and poorly designed partitions. Why was it not thought out at design stage one wonders. Admittedly the expansion of any airport will pose problems as we can all see in Heathrow but one would imagine Dubai and Emirates with its world class ambitions should have learned from the problems of dysfunctional airports and adopt the merits of successful ones. Staff at the transfer counters look overwhelmed and tired from the late arrival and departure of many flights into Dubai. Overall we expected a lot more from Dubai airport and Emirates after all the commercial hype.
Stopped over at this airport twice en route from London to Singapore. Terminal 3 was very busy on my return leg all the ladies toilets in the terminal had queues! On my London to Dubai leg the plane stopped far away from the terminal and we had to take a 20 minute bus to the terminal. The queue to board the Dubai - Singapore Emirates flight was also very messy and chaotic. I would avoid this airport in future.
SIN-CMB-DXB-ZRH CDG-DXB-CMB-SIN. Experiencing Dubai Airport for the first time was horrible. The main sticking point was long queues at immigration. The officers were doing their duty so slowly that all counters had many people queuing. Some counters were not open. Terrible! Terminal was average but toilets were not up to standard very poor compared to Changi Airport. Never again!
After getting off a 14-hour flight myself and the boyfriend got stuck in the passport control queue for an hour and a half. We noticed that half the desks were unmanned and the attendants that were working took their time having 5-minute conversations with each passenger. The service was terrible - our attendant decided he didn't like a couple of guys in the queue and kept them waiting while he let others behind them through with no explanation. It took so long for us to get through that when we finally got to the baggage carousel it had stopped and our bags had been taken off. It was an exhausting experience after a long flight the least they could do is staff their desks.
This airport is huge and bustling. Thank goodness and at long last they seem to have purchased baby strollers so these are actually available now. Avoid buying gold at the duty free its a rip off and u are paying at least 10% over spot. I guess they just try and trap the captive client base they have.
DOH-DXB: Arrived at a gate far away at terminal 1. Once in the hall the usual (regular traveller) chaos of Dubai ensued queues building up then lanes opened up with a mad dash of desperate travellers looking to beat the rush. Unfriendly immigration staff spending as much time talking to each other as actually serving travellers. The only sure way of beating the rush is to book the Marhaba meet and great service I'm suspicious they make immigration so bad that you are forced to use the Marhaba service!. A lovely 65 minutes in the queue then off to find the bags as they had been taken off the belt as normal.
MRU-DXB-MUC with stopover in Dubai. Arrival in the early morning (5.40am) short way to immigration counters. Only half of counters were open each queue of about 20 people. Waiting time 65 minutes! Officers unfriendly and without any kind of motivation. Poor English knowledge. Baggage claim has already finished suitcases were left next to the belt. Quick exit to taxis which are easily accessible and enough in numbers. Check-In (online) so baggage-drop was quick. Efficient security checks but again terrible conditions at the immigration. No problems to spend your waiting time at the shops and cafes.
MUC-DXB-MRU. Transfer from the plane with busses to crowded Terminal 3. 3 hours connecting time in DXB at not a problem with shops and restaurants but too many people. Toilets clean but queues everywhere. Departure from B38 - a terrible small dirty and old part between B and C gates. Again transfer with busses to the plane.
Flew into DXB on 06/11/12. Getting off the plane was fine and had a bit of a walk to Immigration. Then it was a nightmare from then on in. The queues for immigration where horrendous and the whole area was full to the brim. We think nearly every desk was open but you could not see it was that far back every now and then a new line would form and a scramble ensued. We decided to stick with our original line. They took between 3-10 minutes to process 1 passenger. 3 hours later we got through! With no apology or anything we would avoid this airport in future. It is quite appalling and they need to sort this out. The knock on effect is that your bags have been taken off the carousel and stored so more time added. Avoid DXB at all costs fly somewhere else until they sort it out!
GLA-DXB-SYD return (with EK). Have used this airport in the past and have concluded that as long as your aircraft does not end up at a remote stand the airport works fine. Incoming the transfer arrangements in Concourse 2 were OK - not sure that yet another security screen is needed. Outgoing some stellar service from the EK airport staff allowed a group of transit passengers to get off a late-running flight from Sydney at one end of Concourse 2 and onto an outgoing service to GLA - at the other end of Concourse 1 - within 45 minutes
Although it is a very modern impressive airport each time I use Dubai airport I get the feeling that the security level though the hand luggage and body scanners is a bit shambolic. A few days ago on leaving Dubai I forgot that I had a 500ml bottle of water clearly on show in a mesh pocket on my back pack type bag this was not picked out either in the scanner or by the security staff. If the 100ml limit of liquids is very much a safety limit this should be a worry.
Arrival - fine bit of a long taxi and long walk from ramp to get to terminal building Passport Control busy even at 5am but moved quite quickly staff reasonable helpful no real problem. Depart - Terminal 1 was dirty over crowded full of rude people full and full of shops (can't remember seeing any food spaces) taking up all space toilets not nice check in ok but pre security / normal security rowdy chaotic experience. Long queues through passport area to be stamped out of country. Would not recommend as awful experience LHR terminal 3 is better! Future flight to Australia being planned now through Asia rather than Dubai to avoid the airport.
We arrived for the weekend and spent as long trying to get through the immigration process as we had on our flight. The staff were inadequate in numbers badly trained and rude. Our return experience was much the same thank goodness we arrived early. We spent an hour getting through the process. We experienced an extremely rude and unhelpful policeman/security person. An immigration lady who was unable to smile greet and could only grunt! The airport is one long bottle neck with not enough facilities. Our experience has left us in no doubt that next time we shall travel by car. All the staff need retraining. What a truly dismal experience. Rating 0/10!
The other comments are exactly right - was expecting a modern clean world-class airport instead arrived at 2am into an overcrowded chaotic and grubby 3km-long shopping centre.
"Grim experience transiting in both directions between Gatwick and Male with bus transfers to the terminal one in the middle of the night and one in baking heat early afternoon. Have deemed this ""queuing time"". Terminal horribly crowded outbound but only about a quarter as many people on return journey so hard to see that both times this could be down to too many planes competing for the piers. Have done the same journey smoothly twice previously but would avoid Dubai in future and have ruled out transit there for a planned trip to Australia."
Had an hour transit on our way to Barcelona. We were also bussed to the building from a long way off. We just made our connecting flight. I agree that the airport is hectic. On our return flight we had a 3 hour layover. Having flown business class we fortunately did not experience the lack of seating and facilities that seems to be a problem
Dreadful Transit on Emirates. Remote parking and bussing to and from remote stands (10 mins to deplane and 20 mins each way on both Arrival and Departure flights) turned my 2 hour comfortable connection into a mad scrabble to get through the dreadful transit security (15 mins) and the full length of the terminal (10mins) to my connecting flight which if you're not at the gate 35 mins before departure you will not be allowed to board - crazy. Emirates have simply too many flights in and out of DXB which despite Terminal 3 being only 2 or 3 years old is now well over capacity.
Not impressed with the increasing amount of bussing going on in DXB predominantly with Emirates flights - 10 mins taxi-ing to get to some remote stand 10-15 mins to deplane a further 20 mins in a freezing bus and another 15 mins to get through transit security. So that's the thick end of an hour just to get into the Departures Concourse where Emirates expect you to turn up at the gate 35 minutes before departure time and do another 20 minute bus ride back to where you came from. You can just about make a 2 hour transit connection - IF the flight's on time and IF you don't need to go a toilet in the Terminal. Any shorter forget it. The reason for all this? Well it's because DXB has more flight slots than they have gates to service them. And who ends up with all the bussing nonsense? Well Emirates the home carrier of course because if they bussed Cathay Pacific passengers then Cathay Pacific probably wouldn't bother flying to DXB next year. Main Tip - if you have an Emirates connection through DXB make sure it's longer than 2 hours and go to the toilet before landing.
Transited twice through DXB to/from Europe flying Emirates. DXB is a massive let down. I was expecting a shiny new spacious airport only to be confronted by an overcrowded Westfield with some planes attached. The worst part of it is that I will probably fly through here again due to the excellent connection provided from Aus to Europe but not happily.
This airport is geared towards the business / first class traveller with limited concession made for transit passengers on economy. Long queues for toilets limited cafes not enough seating & sporadic signage. With the long & narrow layout making it busier than Oxford St (London) time spent here makes for an unpleasant break from the overall Emirates journey.
First time we have used Dubai for many years as a stopover between UK and Australia and it really has become an unpleasant terminal. Overcrowded no seating and 15 min wait to use very unhygienic toilets. We were on the transfer bus for 25 mins on departure with most people standing. No seating available in the cafes. The terminal is greatly over subscribed and will certainly stop us using Emirates again on this route.
The passenger terminal is insanely overcrowded but the airfield is even worst. After landing from Madrid we spent one hour taxing around the field because there were no ramps available. It's a shame because it offers very good connections between Europe Australia and far east.
I travelled to DXB in Aug-Sep of 2012 and had a very bad experience. I travelled from JFK-DXB for 13 hrs and had to wait at Dubai Immigration lines for another 2 hours. What are those officers thinking. Then comes the over crowded airport - had to wait more than 15 minutes just to use the toilet. Too much shopping. Next time I will travel through Europe.
One of the worst airports I've ever visited. I was exhausted by the time I arrived here at one in the morning after a decidedly uncomfortable flight and was therefore looking forward to what I had thought would be a swanky modern airport befitting a gulf state famous for the emphasis it places on customer service. I was obviously wrong. With its endless rows of Duty Free shops the airport functions more like a shopping mall than a travel terminal and lacks the sort of facilities other less wealthy places have. Sweated like a pig wandering around trying to find a restaurant or café that wasn't besieged by swarms of equally thirsty passengers. Not only were the crowds nigh impossible to navigate through but throughout my entire four- hour long ordeal here I never managed to find a seat
"Arrived 2am from Australia to be faced with thousands of people in the arrivals hall! Took two hours to get to the immigration control desk to be greeted by the official who's only word was ""hotel""? A disgraceful way to treat visitors to the country. The unprofessional conduct of the staff manning the desks had to be seen to be believed as they showed total disinterest with the job at hand and spent most of their time shaking hands and greeting or saying goodbye to fellow workers arriving at or leaving the desks. As a result of the 2hour delay our arranged transfer to the hotel via private vehicle thought we had not arrived and left the airport without us. Finally got to the hotel via taxi at 5.30 am! While I was impressed with the service and standard of food on Emirates the airport experience means I would not fly via Dubai on my next trip. Lift your game DBX or more of us will decide to go via Singapore or other airports where they treat you like a real person."
I am an expatriate resident of UAE and been using DXB International Airport as the gateway to my travels. It is very good to know that the airport has the modern technologies biggest duty free and one of the largest airports in the world. Recently I travelled to Istanbul Turkey via KU and departed and arrived in terminal 1. Unfortunately I am so appalled by the Immigration officers of DXB. Regardless of your nationality or visa status in UAE they will treat you with rudeness impoliteness and arrogance. I highly suggest their quality assurance department to educate and give extensive training to these officers. It is so sad to know that UAE is highly depending on tourism and foreign workers and yet they cannot treat us with respect.
Overcrowding of basic facilities has become a real problem. The last 10 years I've transited or stayed in Dubai over 60 times and the conditions have rapidly deteriorated to the point where I am only using it on my next visit to use the last of my air points. I'd rather face Heathrow and LA now than Dubai. Get rid of some of the shops and put in more of what travellers need - toilet facilities and travelators as the distance from 3 to 1 is horrendous unless young and fit. While we understand the need for security and accept that - at least make it practical and pleasant - and as for everyone having to remove shoes before going through a scanner - buy some decent scanners and check those that come up with a problem - not everyone. I'm sadly disappointed at how bad it has become.
One of the best airports in the world totally let down by the incompetent system at immigration. 2 hours in line and still only half way. Pathetic.
This airport is seriously overcrowded. There are long queues for security checks when transiting once through it is like walking an obstacle course due to sheer number of people in the airport. The ventilation is inadequate making it feel warm most of the time. The furthest gates are 30 minutes walk and there are too many shops to tempt the weary passenger? The number of wash rooms are inadequate resulting in queues for everything!
In short been through Dubai airport 6 times in 4 months and the queues for immigration are ridiculous. If you are a gcc national you get through in ten minutes as for the rest of the world well can wait up to an hour or more to be met by a sour faced officer. Serious training needed here and this from a country that relies so heavily on tourism.
Can only agree with everything said here. I found the airport overcrowded and with little area to get out of everyone's way when you have a long transit time and want to rest: seating is along the walkways and bigger spaces are filled with fast food outlets. Even the gate areas are too small once waiting for boarding. There are insufficient toilet facilities and they are clearly overworked with several urinals and nearly all washbasins out of service in the one I tried. Enormous queues for security check in transit - which is perhaps lucky because signage is very poor and the crowd is about the only way to tell that something probably important is going on here. I could go on - it is very difficult to think of anything good to say about this airport.
I was at the Dubai Airport twice last year on my way to and from London while flying Emirates. Both times I had long transits. On landing I had to face quite a long queue but I didn't have to wait too long to get through. There are lot of shops and restaurants to choose from and overall its quite clean. But the airport is quite crowded and at one time I even had to queue for a long time outside the washroom. Its probably not the ideal airport to take a few hours of rest after a long flight. And the airport Wi-Fi is really poor so using the Internet was difficult.
When you read some review sites and find negative comments you assume it is due to the reviewer having had bad luck and that it is possibly not that bad. However the reviews here are almost the opposite - most reviews are correct and in fact some almost optimistic. I have been to Dubai airport twice in the last six months and on both occasions Emirates parks 15 minutes away from the terminal and they pack you into a bus and drive you to the terminal. Signage isn't too bad - but why all the security checks? Anyway as described you keep going up and down escalators and finally enter a terribly overcrowded terminal concourse which even at 2am is absolutely packed with passengers. Very difficult to find a seat. There was a queue to use the toilets - but they are clean. How could Emirates expand their flights so much without thinking of airport facilities? It was therefore quite a relief to arrive in Changi Airport Singapore as the next stop. It is such a shame you can't avoid this airport if flying Emirates as Emirates is actually a very good airline.
I had a decent transit experience at T3 the first time through here 7 weeks ago. My flight from HYD had the misfortune of being parked at a remote stand which meant wasting 20 minutes on a bus back to the terminal. Once in the transit area no signage regarding what to do if transferring to an airline other than Emirates. Security check was fast. Then came the bizarre process of going down a set of escalators walking 50 feet then up another escalators to the floor we were just on this time a little further down the hall. Then came the hike from the far end of Concourse 2 to the transfer desk for BA at the other end of Concourse 1. What's maddening is that the transfer desks are outside security by just a few feet (amazingly to reach them you are told to go the wrong way through the metal detectors) so after getting my boarding pass I had to go through security again even though I'd just been in a secured area! Finally boarding pass in hand I could head for my gate - only to find yet another useless security check! The whole thing took exactly one hour while speed walking through the terminal enduring 3 security checks during that time 2 of which were unnecessary. At least with the exception of one officer at the third and final security check the personnel I encountered were helpful and efficient. The bottom line after two transits through Dubai - if your arriving flight parks at an aerobridge the process isn't bad taking perhaps 30 minutes though you may have to walk a bit. But all bets are off if you get stuck at a remote stand. That risk alone will put me off from choosing to transit through Dubai again.
A shockingly designed poorly serviced airport. I had the misfortune of experiencing this airport separately with young kids (1yr and 3yrs) and with an elderly less mobile person. The airport is about 3km long and 100m wide. Meaning it is overcrowded and you have to prepare for a half-marathon just to transfer and get your boarding passes only to have to walk another 3km back to get to the next gate. Furthermore there are no parents rooms (baby change rooms) very few trolleys which are simply impossible to find very few restaurants or cafes to sit rest and refresh at with even less tables and chairs. Certainly not an airport you can enjoy. Poor signage unhelpful airport staff and few people actually speak English. I would certainly not recommend this airport.
Terminal 3. I have been here twice this month. There is nothing good about this airport terminal except for the look from outside. Immigration took 60-90 min both times. The immigration staff are the worst I have seen. They are rude and unhelpful. Departure hall was over crowded and was difficult to find a place to sit. For an airline like Emirates this is a complete let down.
Extremely long queues at check-in even worse at immigration. The staff are rude unfriendly and poorly trained. I would not fly from Dubai International if I had the choice.
I was dreading my recent transit through DXB but it was ok. My flight from LHR landed just before 11 pm I thought this would be an awful time. It took 30 minutes from parking (thankfully at an aerobridge) until I got to my onward gate. Almost all that time was spent walking the vast distances of both concourses from one end to another as my arriving flight was at the far end of concourse 1 and the onwards was at the opposite far end of concourse 2. The transfer itself was a breeze
90 minutes queue time on entry. Really slow with their new machines and no information or assistance available. Really bad experience in Terminal 3. Terminal 2 and FlyDubai is so much better than this modern monstrosity that looks like a metal slug and works at the same speed.
Terminal 2 of this airport has the worst conditions. I happened to get stuck in transit in this airport for few days. The condition is terrible: very cold no place to nap very busy poor food no place to charge phone no clean bathrooms and worse than that very rude and unhelpful immigration/airport staff. Terminal 3 of Dubai is very nice and luxurious but if you want to see the real face of Dubai stay in terminal 2 for just one day.
No problems passing through security while transferring. But then a small group of people accompanied by an Emirates ground staff member comes to the security obviously in a rush and skips the queue. No explanation no excuses. It took them 20 minutes all the time we were standing there just being ignored. Dubai Airport is crowded at any given time of the day but in the morning (6 am onwards) it gets really busy. There aren't enough toilets but luckily the rare toilet you will find it kept spotless by the staff. Restaurants are overpriced as at any airport. 6 euro's (8 US dollar) for a coffee and a donut?
Arrived Dubai on 1st April from London. Took 1hr 45 mins to get through immigration at 1am. Half the desks unmanned. Departure later in the week slightly less traumatic only 25 mins. Tip - always aim for a desk with a female immigration officer they work at 2 or 3 times the speed of the men.
This airport especially T3 lets Emirates down very badly. Emirates being a great airline to fly with it but DXB not a great airport to transit. Transiting at 5am on the way to Europe from Australia is an experience not to be repeated. As someone has mentioned before. Massive queues to go through security again must of been 6 B777 flights arriving at the same time we arrived packed into a small area. Lack of seating not to mention waiting over an hour to clear immigration.
Arrived Terminal 2 at 2.00 am after 3 hours flight delay. When we entered had to wait 1 hr for eye scan then another 40 minutes for immigration. Terminal 2 is small to carry a large number of flights. On the way back again have to face a long check-in line although check-in was quite fast. Inside the departure lounge there are limited number of restaurants but overall is a good experience.
The Dubai stopover to change plane was a nightmare. I had passed through a couple of weeks earlier at 5am and it was very busy. Every passenger has to pass through security even for transit. You can't imagine how busy it was at mid-day when I landed on my return. The arrival hall/security was jammed to the point there was no room left. There were no queues just a huge mass of people pushing and shoving. The business lounge is no better - too small and too many people. Shower facilities are very limited. With a stopover of 1.5 hours it was very stressful. Total shambles.
Avoid DXB at all costs: DXB especially Terminal 3 is an over-crowded shopping mall. Other than departure gates Terminal 3 lacks everything that an airport terminal should have: (1) sufficient seating: you will be lucky to find a free seat (2) sufficient toilets: expect long lines and filthy toilets (3) sufficient restaurants: few far and between (4) open space: Every open space is taken up by stores and (5) peace and quiet. Even if you fly with Emirates when you disembark you will probably end up taking a 20-minutes bus ride to the arrival area while numerous jetbridges will be sitting free.
I have transited several times through this airport - its a nightmare. Minimal air-conditioning makes for an uncomfortable experience. The walkways through the airport are narrow and very crowded for the volume of people that pass through. The signage is poor. The onboard emirates service is good in my experience this airport does not do them justice.
You can tell it's a first class airport with forward thinking when building however there are so many flights that go into DXB that it's sometimes overwhelming how many people are there. Last time I went through DXB I stayed overnight in a hotel and the temporary visa experience was awful. Signage not clear whatsoever and immigration officers not too polite.
Enormous and chaotically busy. The Emirates Business Lounge was a disappointment. It's just a big shed with what appear to be thousands of people. Even in the Business Lounge there were queues for the toilets and showers during one transit early in the morning. There were very few tables and chairs for the volume of customers. Food in the Lounge was good
Had a stopover quite a number of times here on a recent trip. If the airplane is parked at a stand it takes a large amount of time to get to the terminal mainly due to the traffic due to other vehicles. Inside airport is very crowded toilets were conveniently placed. For passengers wanting to travel between T3 and T2 and vice versa there is a shuttle bus. Make sure there is adequate time between your flights because the shuttle service only seemed to exist every half an hour or so. T1 is good has a duty free store and some fast food outlets. Not enough power points in fact none at all. The only power points are outside the toilets which are always taken by people wanting to recharge their phones. Free wifi available everywhere in the airport.
I flew on an Emirates ticket to Europe and back stopping over in Dubai. The airport was very crowded with narrow corridors walking to and from gates. All recreational chairs were taken and there was a lack of chairs at gates in general. The so called Food Court consisted only of one Burger King and one Coffee Shop. Internet access was a problem. Most surprising was the lack of toilets and the fact that people actually had to queue up to get into a restroom.
Dubai airport fills me with dread every time I book Emirates. Just a huge shopping mall where you push through the mass to find your way to your gate. On my sixth time through early in the morning there seemed to be every passenger from every plane arrival in a huge mob with no clear queues waiting to get through only half of the working security scanners. An international hub with thousands of passengers/customers with connecting flights can't function successfully without a business attitude towards customer service. Other aspects of transit are good but overall it's not a pleasurable experience.
Security lines are simply too long and exhausting when you have 3 kids and bags to stand for 38 mins waiting. Security guards do not need to be friendly but simple basic courtesy is lacking. Counter staff don't go out of their way to give you the information you need. Not enough seats for passengers on transit - sitting on dirty floors with kids is just unacceptable. Whatever plus points are earned flying emirates are lost with the airport experience.
This must be one of the worst airports. I travel regularly it is inevitable I stop at Dubai for transit - or when the wait is over 8 hours go out to one of their hotels. You walk a lot when arriving because signs/indications are not clear the info desk staff are useless unfriendly and at times plain arrogant. The space where you walk is narrow and the place simply overcrowded. Security staff are impolite and unfriendly. The queues are too long and procedures redundant.
Flight from Dublin to Jakarta stop at Dubai. The plane taxied for ages boarded a bus and took about 10 minutes to arrive at airport. There was long queues for security screening. If you don't allow enough time for your transfer flight you may miss your second flight. 1.5 hours is minimum. The airport is very busy the walk way is narrow and people bumping each other in shopping area. There are no good seating areas until your gate is ready to board.
Over crowded queuing in transit security check. On the other hand once through security - good duty free area. If you have emirates silver/gold card it makes the stay even better with access to the business class lounge! Overall airport and toilets are pretty clean.
I like the service on Emirates flights to and from Asia to UK however every time I dread the transfer at Dubai. Sometimes the walk to the nearest transfer security check feels like a mile. Queues for security are far too long for transfer passengers there is no fast track for first or business passengers - pay a fortune for a first class ticket take part in a scrummage as part of the experience. The signage within the airport is not too good and yes it is always a busy airport. First class lounge is very good though plenty of space free spa facilities good food. Duty free is expensive.
When transiting at DXB if you're unlucky enough to arrive at one of the busy times (early morning in particular) you'll face a significant wait for security checks. This problem pales into insignificance though when compared with the biggest issue: the utter inadequacy of the bathrooms in the concourse area. I've seen lines of 15-20 men waiting outside the bathroom with another 10 inside. If on a short layover at DXB go straight to the gate and there is likely to be a much quieter bathroom there. Of course this is no help to people on 4hr+ layovers who have to wait until the gate opens. Fix this one issue and it would be a decent layover option rather than one I dread.
Huge departure hall with bag drops crammed into corners. No one at e-check in to help. Waited ages to bag drop one man vaguely calling the latest flight people forward - people arriving far too early for flights! Security is painfully slow Emirates staff have no sense of urgency. Upstairs in shopping area - busy crammed. Gates small nothing special. Signs confusing. Really very disappointed. I would put on a level with Heathrow rather than HKG or even BKK airport.
Arrived on Emirates A380 for two hour transit in early hours of the morning. Long walk from gate to security then a long and disorganised queue for screening. Once through security there were thousands of people milling around in the narrow overcrowded shopping area. So many people that it was difficult to walk without stopping and starting to avoid people. Not enough seats and far far too few restrooms. The restrooms which do exist are too small. I don't think I have ever seen a long queue to enter male restrooms at any other airport. Lack of space seems to be a recurrent feature which is surprising given that it is very new and supposed to be the second largest building in the world.
Arrived at 00.30 by A380 and was astonished to see overcrowding at transit security with queues backing right up against two sets of elevator doors (obviously people arriving upstairs by lift rather than escalator could hardly get out into the security area). After about ten minutes another security gate was opened and the previous chaos began to settle down. Then checked out prices at the duty free shop I had UK high street prices incl. VAT with me for comparison of five different cameras (five different brands). All were cheaper at retail stores in the UK.
Airport is very confusing and staff not helpful or friendly. Was stuck at the airport for a good 9 hours due to a transfer from Dubai to Munich. Experience was not good at all. Was not very impressed. Certainly will not stay longer than I have to again.
At a busy time of year it is surprising that they are doing lots of upgrading work. The showers are now closed. Large areas of seating and restaurants are boarded up. It is also a shame there are no areas to sit and relax. I was lucky that my stopover was only 2.5 hours - it would be awful if it was any longer.
"Istanbul to Dubai. Took me around 2-3 hours to check out to spend a few hours in the hotel before my flight to Durban. I found the staff extremely rude and arrogant. Had to queue in long lines for hours - eye scan/bank/customs. The staff on the ground had no idea where I should go. I spent around 30 mins in a line and when I got to the end of the line the lady behind the counter shouted ""go there"" i.e. next line and she closed her counter. Had to join the next line at the back. Would avoid this airport even if it cost me more to fly with another airline."
DXB terminal 3 is very busy around the standard transfer times (midnight-3am eastwards 5-8am westwards). Facilities are good but not enough. Shops very busy. Hard to find a free seat in the business class lounge. And amazingly although the toilets and showers look very luxurious at first sight they are not properly cleaned and very busy at peak times. (Never saw a waiting line at the men's before). Suggestion: Terminal 1 is more quiet and relaxed.
Beware: if you are in transit you will in all probability encounter long queues for security check. As of now more than 400 people waiting in 6 lines even at 7 am. The central lobby has just too many transit passengers. Consider your self lucky if you didn't bump into a fellow passenger from the opposite direction. Well a surprise for Business Class passengers - you will need to hunt to find a seat. All goods are more expensive in duty free shop. Care must be exercised.
I pass through DXB about a dozen times a year on Emirates. I would love to know the percentage of flights where passengers are bussed to and from the terminal because in my experience it's around 30% and it's getting boring. 10 minutes to fill up the busses and a 20 minute ride in a freezing cold box before being dumped into the Arrivals Zoo. Meanwhile back at the gates there are dozens of foreign airlines neatly parked at one of the 200+ gates. So why are Emirates bussing so many passengers at DXB? Well the airport have sold all of these Landing Slots into an airport which is simply not big enough to park all the aircraft at gates so in order to squeeze them all in the national flag carrier is bussing passengers to and from parking areas - at their home airport. Total disgrace.
Arrival is awful. Eye scan and border control took me 1 hr 40 min! Departure from terminal 3 good self check-in waiting areas. Lots of shops with good prices cafes/restaurants very good too.
Terminal 3 easy transfer through security good signage. Pleasant waiting areas. Terminal 3 has a vast array of shops. Used the terminal hotel which while rather expensive but easy to find and is a pleasant haven if you have a long layover.
I have used this airport twice and will never use or recommend it again. Security staff are rude and not friendly and courtesy staff do not understand English. Three times I asked for baby change rooms and was pointed to the baby strollers information desk and the lifts. Had to transit in Dubai so had to leave the airport. That in itself was a nightmare as it wasn't clear where to go. The actually airport is satisfactory but airport staff need to improve dramatically to meet the image Dubai portrays.
Flew to and from Terminal One on arrival had a long walk from the gate to immigration which took the best part of an hour and once through you can use the Duty Free shop prior to collecting your baggage. On return at 3am in the morning had to pass through security prior to entering the check in area and then before entering the departure area - once through the terminal is disappointing and looks more like a low cost terminal compared to Terminal 2 and 3 and is reminiscent to something from the 1980's.
We had to transit in Terminal 3 two times. We faced the nightmare overcrowded noisy and dark. Just a modern souk with not enough toilets or areas for rest. Rude security staff yelling like soldiers. Decorated with an awful taste. This airport does not live up to Emirates concept of excellence.
Terminal 3. Two transits 3 and 2 hours arriving respectively at midnight and 1 pm local time. Long walks mean I wouldn't want to make a very tight turnaround here. Good size boarding gate lounges and in some places there was chaise longue-type seating. Clean staff courteous clear announcements racks of toddler buggies for families. Golf carts transporting less mobile passengers around were driven a bit aggressively. Security queues not long. Hard to see what more one might want from an airport while in transit.
Have used Terminal 1 a few times in 2011 arriving around 21.30. Walking distance is long. The arrival gates seem to be on the other side of a taxi-way and passengers walk through a long tunnel (underneath the taxi- way/runway) to the immigration area. The queuing for visitors is always long - about 30 people and the processing time per visitor is about 2 minutes for picture taking and eye-scan. Immigration officers are slow unfriendly and not welcoming to visitors.
This is a shopping mall not an airport - too crowded noisy not enough seats no quiet area. Cunningly planned so that you spend more time in the shops.
This airport is a nightmare. Arrived late in the evening 23.30. Connection flight was scheduled 4.10 am although unfortunately there was a delay. I was searching for a smoking lounge in T3 - not available. Tried to find a seat to get some sleep over night but none were available. Tried to connect to the free WiFi - not available. When finally sitting at the gate waiting for boarding the Aircon was round 15 degrees Celsius. Without my winter jacket that I had in my hand luggage I would have been frozen.
This review pertains only to Terminal 3. Overall unimpressed especially considering it is only 3 years old. Enormous (takes at least 30 mins to walk end-to-end) overcrowded stuffy and a severe lack of toilets. I had to queue to use the men's toilets which is almost unheard of anywhere. Showers were entirely useless as they didn't provide towels soap or shampoo. It seems when they designed this place it was meant to be a shopping mall first and an airport second. One plus is the duty free has some of the best liquor prices I've seen.
I have been through Dubai Terminal 2 twice and both times have been awful. Staff are rude the Charterbus took 1 hr each time I have been there one of my transits was 8 hrs and I was forced not to smoke because the smoking areas were closed for maintenance. Conclusion my first flight via Dubai was a trial the second I was forced because I didn't have a different way to reach Yerevan from Jordan and I promised myself there will not be a 3rd time.
Arriving around 4.30 am in transfer from BKK to AMS I found DXB a decent airport for its size. There is quite some walking to be done including a security check but that is common at any large airport. The airport gets quite busy around this time as many flights arrive and departing around 7.00 am again. During these hours the airport begins to look like an overcrowded shopping mall. The Emirates Business Class lounge is quite good. Lots of space plenty of places to rest eat or drink. This lounge gets a bit crowded but it is acceptable. I wonder what DXB will look like when the expansion of Emirates will continue but for now it's a good and convenient alternative to direct flights from Europe to the Far East.
"Have been through this airport 5 times. None of the times the free wifi worked. Bus arrivals can easily take 15 mins to reach the gate. The airport isn't very well thought through lots of walking too crowded and redundant security checks. Most staff are simply rude. Most ""open"" smoking areas are closed for maintenance and the few open are awful. It's clean and luxurious but in many ways far below standard."
Transit on T3. Airport was overcrowded and busy. Connection between flights was easy and smooth although there was no place to unwind (apart from lounges) to relax. Shops and eateries everywhere.
The airport is clean but improvements need to be made. On of my arrival we were bussed to the airport which I found strange as we flew in on a B777. The terminal seems to be a big duty free but after 3 shops you've seen most items the airport has to offer. Both my flights from Dubai to Paris and Singapore via Colombo took off 1 hr late. For me the airport has been one of the less well organised I've been transiting in.
Dubai International Terminal 3 is pretty good. I was impressed with its cleanliness although the Size of the airport makes it difficult to find the boarding gates. Queuing time for Economy class passengers at check-in desks are not great. Staff do their job well and are very helpful although struggle to smile. The airport's Terminal 1 is large and congested but Terminal 3 lives up to the hype.
Have been through this place twice and - rather like Dubai itself - it doesn't even get close to living up to the hype. Main issue is completely inadequate seating to the extent you have to go and buy something from the fast food joints just so you can sit down somewhere. I saw people dead asleep across what seats there were lying under them or collapsed over piles of luggage. The toilet facilities are characterised by long queues plus many people pushing their way to the front. Once you actually get to a cubicle you generally find excrement and urine all over the floor - maybe they are scent-marking their territory? Having walked miles to the departure gate I had to deal with PA announcements that are extremely loud and almost incomprehensible: when they start calling the rows everyone gets up and barges through to the desk regardless of where they are sitting on the aircraft.
Dubai airport is as expected for any international airport. My complaint would only be the uncaring attitude of the customer service agents at boarding/transit gates. The transit agents premark their surveys (rating themselves excellent) and ask passenger to sign and seal it. When I asked the boarding agent at this gate if my companion and I could get adjacent seats (not 5 rows away) her response was you should have checked in online and selected the seats 24 hrs before. That would be difficult considering I purchased tickets 24 hrs ago and got on their Emirates flight and their agent had selected our seats.
Dubai had been trying very hard and spent a lot of money promoting Emirates as the global airline of choice - one thing they obviously forgot in the process was ensuring Dubai is as efficient as other large hubs in handling large volume of passengers. So we have an airport that is poorly designed poorly sign posted massively crowded staffed by people who have no idea how to handle high passenger traffic. It is light years behind Hong Kong and Singapore.
I was very excited to be in T3 as many across the world have waited for its construction with anticipation and how good it is going to be. But when I landed in contrary to my expectations the airport was very average. The shopping area and the number of shops wouldn't be even in my top-10 list. I felt the airport in itself is designed after Bangkok airport and there is nothing innovative or great about it the interiors also were pretty average. The signboards were horrible they were very inconsistent and it actually takes few minutes for you to figure out which way to go. The airport hotel within is pretty good but expensive and the horrible thing is that they use airport wifi and the signals are not good. Aren't you supposed to make sure wifi is available in today's world of communications. I was very aggravated by this! The Marhaba lounge is decent and plenty of restaurants. This is one good part of the airport. A good airport but nothing to rave about.
I love that Airport. My flight was Doha-Dubai-Cairo I had to spend 2 or 3 hrs there in transit with my wife and baby daughter. The service was excellent the staff were helpful and the airport was clean. I almost missed my flight due to the large size of the airport and the fact that I didn't hear the Speakers calling for my trip.
Had 2 transits recently at Dubai International 5 hours and 2 hours respectively. The security checks were pretty quick with security staff guiding everyone on where to queue up. It was pretty organised. The waiting areas were spacious however there was quite a distance to walk before reaching the boarding gate. Lots of shops selling practically anything but it was quite messy and disorganized. Last but not least toilets were relatively clean and in working order with cleaners mopping the floor every few minutes. But people had to queue up to use the cubicles for the Gents. More toilets needed. Staff were knowledgeable with regards to flight information.
Security clearance was confusing and redundant. Bags (including cabin luggage) had to be security cleared before passengers can check in. Then after immigration and before entry into the air-side area carry-on bags and passengers are security cleared again. And when passengers get to their gate they are security cleared again. That's not to say checks are very good either. Apparently you have to have your laptops scanned separately. Well no one told me that. So mine stayed in the bag. But no one either noticed it or cared. Security staff are also rude and cannot communicate adequately.
A very poor experience. Airport staff rude and not informative all around. Queues everywhere. Not enough seating around gates. Being in transit here is just a torture. It is impossible to find anything by signage and no use asking Information Counter staff as they are neither knowledgeable nor polite. I have to give credit for the free WiFi and power points which are awesome. Too bad there's no seating/waiting area around. Catching a connection could be quite a challenge unless you have at least 5 hours in between to find your way and get through all the obstacles.
Recently transited on Emirates flights. The problem seems to be the construction workings which are overwhelming the coach transfer from aircraft to terminal. On arrival our coach took around 20 mins to the terminal and departure slightly less to the aircraft Its just not acceptable for a modern international hub and I thought T3 was a modern terminal! Communications are also a problem we sat in a dated poorly finished departure lounge for almost 3 hours 2 of which were after being told there would be a 15 minute delay in boarding and then we discovered the information given to us was untrue.
Many improvements are needed to make Dubai Airport world standard. Non-checked through baggage transfer between airlines is atrocious (Marhaba charges USD80). Queuing for boarding passes at Counter C Terminal 1 is mayhem - lots of pushing and jostling. You cannot claim a boarding pass for collecting flights until 3 hours before flight time. Similarly if checking in from outside (ie Departures entrance) the gates only open 3 hours before departure time. Dubai Airport is stylish but let down by performance - style and little substance.
Had 2 flights via Dubai at around 0200 am local time airport was clean they have a garden with Chinese-like trees. I love the flat seats they have at all gates you can get a short sleep there. The only thing I can not recommend were the restrooms. They had some in the european and American style there most of them were arabic style means just holes in the ground. It smelled and was not clean.
"Security staff are arrogant with little or no sense of Customer Service. I had a vital piece of equipment confiscated from my luggage on the pretext that it was ""dangerous"". The item was a small roll of soft rubber strip about 150mm diameter. It was a specially made part for a 90 year old vintage car and I told them that. The woman said it was not allowed; I protested that it was soft rubber and could not harm anyone or anything. She called her supervisor who told me it was ""very dangerous"" - his tone was arrogant as well as stupid. So I lost something worth a lot of money. Personally I will never travel to Dubai ever again."
This was my second time to transit from Dubai from Guangzhou. Arrival was smooth although at 3am all the walking to the next boarding gate can be quite a challenge. The main walkway passing through the duty free shops makes it easy for passengers to bump into each other the mass of humanity at such an early hour of the day can be very overwhelming and at times claustrophobic. Toilets are an issue queuing is the norm sometimes the faucet sensors don't work. Lots of long distance walking to one's boarding gate and you don't need that when you didn't have enough sleep.
Transited terminal three. Was somewhat lucky that my arriving flight was right at security and departure gate was close to the escalator. Security was fairly busy but the line moved quickly. I had some time to spare so tried to find a place to watch the planes. The windows in the terminal are opaque so you can't see out of them. Had a look at the shops but there are no bargains to be had there. Long lines for toilets so ended up walking to the old terminal which used to resemble a refugee camp. It's now a lot quieter and far more pleasant than the new terminal.
Transit both ways MAN to SYD. Main thoroughfare is very crowded and seating at a premium. Security checks are a pain and the need to go up and down on escalators and lifts after arrival is very annoying. Poor design. Shops and Duty Free are not very inspiring either and considering what this place must have cost it is particularly disappointing.
Transited Terminal 3. Although a huge terminal space it does not appear to be well designed or anywhere near capable of handling the huge number of passengers that transit through it at peak periods meaning there are not enough toilets - you have to queue at every one not enough showers queues for everyone not enough seating (very little at all) long queues to clear security when transiting actually you are quicker to go through passport control - and use the facilities landside as there is no congestion very few places to eat or have a drink. Prices of those places expensive there are a lot of shops but it is not cheap - and all the shops are in the centre of the terminal which means people trying to get to and from gates have to pass through the shopping area making for complete chaos. Boarding process very slow and again not well organised. I do not recommend this airport to transit.
"In Transit at Dubai last week and four weeks before that. The total lack of a sufficient number of toilets. No matter which toilet I tried there was always a queue waiting taking you at least 10-15 mins. For an airport this size you would expect them to plan for enough toilets but obviously they did not. Not enough seating at the gates. Before you go down into the ""real"" waiting room the seating at the gate is only 1/3 of what it should be. On both arrivals we had to be bussed to the terminal (both Emirates flights!). Is there really no parking closer than 15 mins away!? In all of the terminal only 1 ATM accepts european MAstercard/Cirrus cards. All the rest display the Cirrus Logo but it doesn't work."
In transit through Terminal 3 twice this week. On both occasions lengthy transit security queues crowded terminal limited free seating and toilet facilities poor. Definitely not a world class facility and one to be avoided if at all possible.
Use Dubai T1 every month and it is good. Fast arrivals and when departing efficient check-in fast security good shopping airline lounges okay. Only drawback the linear design of the terminal at the gates which requires long walks. Also weird to see that the gate the flight is leaving from is always at the opposite side of the terminal when comparing to the lounge locations.
Is it over a mile from end to end? Certainly felt like it when connecting from a late inbound flight to catch connecting flight and having to transit almost the whole length of the terminal at 2am. avoiding shoppers and the mass of other passengers after delays clearing transit security. Seems to be a shortage of toilet facilities also of flight information screens. Return trip better bussed from arriving aircraft to terminal (took 15 minutes of interminable driving around the airport!) but at least it deposited us close to our departure gate and transit security not busy. Definite lack of toilets and comfortable seating resorted to using Cafe Cadiz on first floor part of the Dubai International Hotel. Avoid Dubai Terminal 3 if possible.
Terminal 3 departed on an 0830 flight DXB to Cape Town. A terrible experience with toilets crammed and dirty shopping a crush buying a coffee was a 20 minute line and no seating available anyway to wait for the flight. A very very unpleasant and stressful experience. Contrast this with the calm and serenity of Bangkok Singapore or Hong Kong and Dubai has a lot of work to do.
I transit DXB every month (usually in the middle of the night or early morning) and the previous posts are correct - at some times of the year the queues at transit security are lengthy and at other times non-existent. I came through the other day in 5 minutes but the longest couldn't have been more than 20 minutes. The size of the terminals and the often lengthy walks involved can be a real challenge in making a connection of anything less than 2 hours. Also Emirates seem to be back into bussing mode again - and not 5 minutes either - 15 or 20 minutes bus rides from remote stands are not uncommon. A ridiculous situation for an airline at their home base. If you're connecting with another Emirates flight they factor this in and the flight will hold for 10 or 20 minutes if there's a significant number of connecting passengers missing.
I wonder if they have finally got the message? In the past my experience has been that the transit security was an enormous free for all with massive queues and extremely incompetent staff. On both outbound and inbound legs of my journey this time the experience was different. No queues to speak of and plenty of staff around so all lines were open. The staff are no more diligent than before. The chap supposedly screening the bags was having a chat with another member of staff and taking not a bit of notice of the screen nothing new there but at least it was all over quickly. Airport crowded as usual but far fewer people sleeping in the corridors.
I was in transit for few hours. The queue is a huge mess - after 7 hours flight had to queue for security just so we can go to another terminal! Airport clean however is so big and you have to walk a lot and is really exhausting. If you are travelling with kids or elders please don't go to Dubai because it is really stressful. Use Dubai airport as your last choice.
More style than substance. Outbound flight delayed so had to rush for connecting flight. Inadequate signage and lengthy queues at security - we had to push to the front and insist on queue-jumping to catch our flight! Return journey no better. Lack of information which way to go and how to transit. Again long queues at security. Will try to avoid this airport in future. Not a good experience.
I transited through DXB T3 twice last month. I found the terminal very crowded with queues for customs and toilets. I was not able to find a seat to wait for my connection flight.
Transited between 2am-7am and while the transit is pretty efficient there are nowhere near enough toilets or places to sit and wait. The only seats are in cafe's etc or in the actual departure gate. We paid 45Dh each for a shower in the health club we should have bought a travel sized towel and used the free showers. It is a bit of a circus and totally packed wall to wall with people but pretty civilised given the numbers that pass through.
Transited through Dubai airport. They have certainly spent a lot of money on the building however there has been no thought to either the number of toilets available for a whole plane load of tourists nor how they have set up their security - and the walk fron the plane to security was so long our flight was called when we were half way to security. It was a case of run to security then line up. People were sitting everywhere on the floor and no one moving. After a 15 hour flight from Brisbane this is not what anyone needs.
Was in transit with Emirates and exclusively in Terminal 3. OK so it looks impressive from outside and it is impressive inside but when your inbound flight is delayed and you have to get to your outbound connection in 20 mins it is not easy. The airport is too large and there should have been more thought put into how passengers get around in transit. We had to go from our gate to security then all the way back out to the gates. There were large queues at security and there was no allowance for the large group of passengers who were rushing for the connecting flight. There were very long queues at security. The duty free areas were OK but the stalls in the middle of the corridor/walkway meant that with passengers going in different directions along the narrower walkways it became congested at times. The airport could do with more seating and perhaps reclining/flatbed seats at the gates. The airport toilets could do with being cleaned more often as there was always a lot of water/fluid on the floor.
Arrived at Dubai International and it was a complete chaos! It was around midnight and was not ready for the marathon to get my baggage. The queue at immigration was slow. As my next flight with Emirates has a transit of more than 8hrs I was given the complimentary hotel stay at the Millenium airport hotel which was excellent. Few minutes drive from the airport. Check in not so chaotic as I anticipated. Lots of self check in and multiple baggage drop counters. The duty free area is another experience . The bathrooms were not as bad as posted here before plenty of place to sit and relax and free wifi is not bad.
I transit via Dubai 4 to 6 times a month and have to say it works. Of course the interminable bus transfers across the apron are a pain. Security is reasonable in terms of waiting time. My main gripe is the noise level: an almost constant stream of boarding calls - ridiculous at an airport this size with dozens of information screens littered around the concourse. They even have separate calls in the EK lounges which make it impossible to sleep.
I agree the terminal 3 is uninspiring overcrowded and not easy to transit since the design puts everything in a line and not in a square shape - so going from one side to the other is a painful journey. There is no good restaurants at all and facilities not the best. Staff is rude and many of them seem not to know where do they work. The duty free is more expensive than Dubai itself. It's going to be 2 years old and it looks already overused. And the design - what to say about a building made with no taste and cheap materials.
Used T1 flying LH from DXB to MUC. Airport was very quiet around 6AM on Friday check-in and security with no lines. Terminal showing its age already. Enough shops and food courts. Main problem is the very long walks to the gates (terminal is a long array no hub-and-spokes) and the hundreds of people spending the night sleeping in the hallways. Not a terminal where one wants to spend a long lay-over.
What a terrible airport Shops in abundance but the emirates terminal was so packed both times I have passed through it has been deeply unpleasant. Food and drink wise it's horrendous mass queuing at small outlets with few staff. I waited 20 mins for just an ice tea. The seating facilities are little more than pathetic people sat everywhere on railings all over the floor at a major airport . From travelling from Bangkok airport which is very smart with good facilities to Dubai you wouldn't believe the investment that has been put into the Dubai airport. Even transit from the plane took mirrored a journey travelling down the m6 slow moving traffic for about 30mins after a long flight is extremely poor. The airport very much mirrors Emirates very big and flash on the outside but in reality it's vastly disappointing lacking any class real investment and far too over crowded.
They need to increase the number of toilets showers seating. It is unbelievable that a major transit airport like Dubai does not have enough toilets and showers - there are actually long lines flowing out into the terminal seating areas and duty free shops. The seating is poor - its a transit airport with people coming from all over the world connecting to flights to the other side of the world and there are not enough seats. The food selection is quite poor and nothing great. The internet facilities are beyond a joke. There's a long long walk to get to a tiny booth with old computers to use the internet. The pay phones are just silly as well. The cleaning people are always helping people use the phones as the dialing system in just crazy. The staff at immigration are really just plain rude. Not a single smile or hello and quite serious looking faces and grins. Dubai International have got a long way to go to begin coming close to Singapore's Changi Airport
What a shambles! Long bus trips around the airport long long queues at the very lax security inadequate and very misleading signage Lounges in Terminal 3 more akin to a railway station in rush-hour. Overpriced shops blocking passenger flow through the airport and possibly a fire hazard.
Transited this airport twice this month and they have improved the lines for security. The fact that I did not bother to remove the liquids from by carry on or take of my belt and no- one even glanced at either the scanner or the body x-ray makes the security screening a bit of a joke. Like all other comments I dislike the T3 Business lounge. It is open to all the noise from the main concourse because of the open plan design grossly overcrowded especially in the morning and the shower and toilet facilities are a joke.
I used to think T1 was a mess (and it was) until now a year into operation T3 is actually worse. The other posts say it all - shopping toilets noise crowding - just generally a very poor experience for passengers who have to use the place - and a bad advertisement for Emirates. The only good thing is that they seem to be bussing fewer flights from remote stands than a year ago but a 2-hour connection is as tight as you'd want to get. I prefer the Emirates Business Lounge in T1 to that awful place in T3. Also Emirates have a bad habit of going from Gate Open to Boarding and onto Final Call - all in the space of 10 minutes some 40 or 50 minutes before scheduled flight departure time - and having passengers all dashing across this very large terminal only to have to wait 20 minutes before they can actually board. I'm sure the architect's sketches of T3 look fantastic - sadly the reality is less so.
T3 is shocking - it's a cattle market and is getting worse. Emirates need to get a grip on this quickly. It is the noisiest airport I have recently encountered passenger announcements boom out about 50 times per hour there are no dedicated quiet areas which trust me is a major issue in this hub airport where long stop-overs are common. It is also common to see 30 men queuing to use the toilet facilities if it is this bad for men I dread to think what the Ladies are experiencing. There are no-where near enough seats and I did not see any facilities allocated for families with young children such as a play area. this was not an issue for me but I did see many frustrated parents and tired fidgety children. Emirates will quickly find that people will by-pass using their airline once the reputation of T3 spreads.
Terminal 1 excellent nice staff shops good toilets and excellent food and drinks. Terminal 3 looks state of the art but is utterly terrible. Dreadful toilets dire food and drink unless MacD's is your thing. The staff were excellent though.
GLA-DXB T3. Overnighted in Dubai under Emirates STPC arrangements. While the queuing times for crossing the border were pretty good the staff were unfriendly. Facilities are quite limited - not even any free Internet terminals like Singapore. Toilet facilities especially atrocious both in terms of location and capacity - with a large number of people needing to queue. Return in transit to GLA from MEL. The transit times at 5-30am were OK (ten minutes for security no passport check required) but it was not helped by Emirates policy of parking aircraft miles (literally) away from the terminal and then bussing us. The concourse (T3-concourse 2) is already too small and another concourse (T3-concourse 3) is being built to its the south-east. Ultimately T3 is like Dubai itself - glitzy but ultimately superficial.
T3. Upon arrival we were sardined-packed into busses. And the journey was a very long one which took 10+ mins from aircraft to the terminal. Upon arrival all passengers had to go through a baggage check - with only 2 x-ray scanners - took another 40 mins. So a total of almost 50 mins to get from my aircraft to the building. Once inside I thought I was in an extremely over-crowded supermarket. Toilets could not be found. The only good thing is the economy class lounge with buffet with free wi-fi.
"Had the ""pleasure"" to arrive and depart from Dubai terminal 1. My flight was suppose to arrive at terminal 1 but was directed to terminal 3 due to lack of gates. Bags were transferred to terminal 1 which caused chaos among the passengers. There was no info about where to get the bags. Pax were expected to clear customs at terminal 3 take a bus to terminal 1 and get back into the arrival area to collect their bags. It took me almost 2 hrs to get my bags; and I was one of the fist ones to get them. I wonder what happened to the wheelchair bound passengers. Departure from Terminal 1 was utter chaos with rude security officers and endless lines waiting for security and immigration processing. Terminal 1 in Dubai is a disgrace."
Hong Kong to Milan on Emirates via Dubai T3. What an awful airport for transit - took more than an hour to get to the main terminal after touch down. Once inside it was like a jungle. All washrooms had huge line-ups and very filthy. Staff at departure gates were cold and unfriendly. Would I ever transit via Dubai? No way!
I am a regular business class traveller on Emirates. I flew to Perth via Dubai recently. On my return journey picking up the London Heathrow connection at 7.45 AM I was apalled to see that Emirates had a very limited number of X- ray machines for passengers in transit. The huge queue resulted in almost missing the flight and certainly very little time to enjoy the business class lounge facilities. This has become a common reoccurance with all of the flights from Asia and Australia arriving at the same time at Emirates dedicated terminal 3. It is only after complaining to the X ray machine operators about our urgent departure for London that we were advised that the dedicated First/business class X ray and body scan machine could have been used. Emirates really need to sort out the huge passenger backlog and security scan issue for passenger in transit or the airport staff must organise the scan more efficiently and quickly. Either way why do we need a further X ray scan whilst this has already occurred at departure point?
"My family and I have just returned from 3 days in Dubai. We got held on arrival for 4hrs at the airport by customs because my husband had a telescopic lens in his suitcase. It was a very expensive gift given to him and it was confiscated. They just said ""not allowed"". I have yet to find anywhere that it says it was a banned item! This was not a weapon but somehow they thought it was! No we won't be returning and be very careful on what you take in!"
I have always been critical of Dubai as a transit passenger because of the rather soulless lounge and the security queue length and lack of priority lane. I was amazed at the dedicated first and business class check in at terminal three - smooth and efficient and security screening was swift and professional. No change with the lounge though.
T3 in Dubai and T3 in Singapore are what you would call polar opposites. Dubai is a noisy poorly organised poorly laid out horrible experience. As a frequent flyer in business class I have access to the huge business lounge which boasts uncomfortable seating open air layout so you get all the noise from the levels below overcrowding at peak times queues for toilets unhelpful staff and a twenty minute walk to a connecting flight depending on where you are flying. Well done Emirates you have actually created a business lounge more uncomfortable inside than out! Must save you millions.
As long as you are not being bussed from aircraft to terminal or vv T3 is ok. Fair enough the personnel at the various security check points are not the brightest - but then are they elsewhere? The main architectural gripe is the linear layout of the building which makes for sheer endless walks from one end to the other. Also there is no post office in T3 - you have to go to T1 for that.
I transited through T3 for Bangkok at the new year. My first impression is that it is full already! The facilities are not improved at all - shopping is uninspiring the bars are not for me toilets not enough. The business class lounge is just a cafe! I took the long walk through to T1 which was a cheerless experience but I did reflect that when it was opened it was a great improvement on its predecessor - which is not repeated in its present incarnation.
"Beware of this airport. Travelling Business Class Emirates transiting through Dubai Airport. Security confiscated my laser pointer! This was in my hand baggage. No explanation - and very rude. I requested to see a senior after some discussion he passed me on to some one else - again a rude ""not allowed"". A lot of people travelling to/from a meeting or conference carry a pointer - clearly passengers travelling to a meeting/conference should avoid going through Dubai if possible."
Had the misfortune to transit through Dubai T3 on a couple of occasions in both instances flying Emirates on all legs. Both transits involved a long bus trip from aircraft to the terminal security checking (whilst necessary) was incredibly slow - far worse than other hubs such as AMS & SIN. Signage is very poor - although the terminal layout is relatively simple Main problems however are overcrowding and poor provision of facilities. As mentioned by other reviewers - the T1 problems were meant to be solved by T3 - maybe now T1 is OK but T3 is chaos. It appears that there are only around 4 sets of WCs for the main transit level with queues for the gents as well as ladies - possibly better to wait until you get through into the gate holding area before using the WC if possible although I'm not sure if there is WC provision in all of these. Very few seats available for the number of people wanting to use them and in general staff were unhelpful. Lots of bling shops if that's your bag but no focus on providing a quality service for passengers just wanting to transit. Had hoped T3 would make the 'Emirates' experience rival SIA etc but no way. Goodness knows what it will be like when load levels get back to full capacity and over the longer term when flight volumes increase. Somewhat amazingly it would appear that the architects have a long track record of airport terminal design - so maybe this was a 'Friday afternoon' terminal. It certainly is a sufficiently grim travelling experience to strongly consider paying a premium to travel with another carrier whenever possible.
Three hour wait in Terminal 3 in the early hours of the morning. Terribly crowded with all sorts of shops wanting to get their hands on your cash. If you're looking for something to eat and think you might find some interesting Middle Eastern food forget it - Macdonalds and Starbucks is about it unless you want to spend lots of money on seafood and champagne. Toilet provision is terrible - maybe about two or three sets of facilities per gender all with long queues and water sloshing around the cubicle floors. I suppose you have to endure it in order to take advantage of Emirates flights but it's not an enjoyable experience.
The new terminal at Dubai is great very modern and easy to find things. The restaurants and bars are a bit on the expensive side but what airport is not. The toilets are clean and the airport did not seem crowded at all. The only problem is the long walk from Terminal three (the new one) to the old terminal. I found the sign posting hard to follow and it is a lot of walking up and down. This would be the drawback for the new terminal as I personally found the old Emirates terminal crowded and unpleasant but this one is much better.
"Travelling through Dubai Airport is in my opinion one of the worst experiences of my life. Long aircraft taxi (10 mins+) followed by a long bus ride to the terminal from what feels like the other end of Dubai long queues extremely unfriendly and arrogant staff and a ""shopping mall"" departure lounge with too few chairs for passengers. My main gripe however is with the security personnel. I have travelled through numerous airports with my laptop bag including Dubai only the week before. On this occasion I was stopped because my laptop bag had a security cable lock packed in the bag. This was confiscated off me because it was deemed to be dangerous. The security personnel left me feeling like a criminal and wondering if I was going to be chucked into jail for this offence. I have travelled through a number of airports with the same device and have never had it questioned as something that is prohibited onboard as hand luggage. I have also done an extensive search on the internet and did not find one single site where this device has been flagged as prohibited. This is one airport (and Emirates as the airline) that I will be avoiding at all costs from now on."
Terminal 1. Arriving from Doha on Qatar Airways at 21.00. Aircraft parked on a remote stand bus took us right to the immigration centre - we didn't have to walk long distances. Immigration busy about 20 desks open and maybe 10 people in each queue but the process was relatively efficient - waited 10-15 minutes. By the time I arrived at luggage reclaim by bag was there. Departure - at the airport at 04.30 for a 06.00 departure. Already checked in online and no queue at Qatar desk. Formalities efficient and a long walk via travelators underground to the departure area. I used the duty free shop - typical choice and prices. I didn't use any other facilities at the airport so I cant comment. Plenty of places to sit and wait.
The new T3 is a huge disappoinment. Handling of transfer passengers (big business in DXB!) is awful - the design of the airport just doesn't work at all in this respect. Nowhere near enough toilets - queues even for the gents! Poor signage. Need to get from T3 to T1? Make sure you pack your gym kit. Long walk and not too many travelators to help you. Immigration staff are much slower compared with any other place I have visited. Why put these locals there when they are not prepared to work! Using Emirates  our aircraft was still parked miles away from the terminal for which we had to take a long bus journey to terminal. All glitz and glamour as is always the case with Dubai but no substance. First world on the surface third world thinking underneath.
I transited at DXB twice over the last two months. Every time I was arriving on an Emirates flight and connecting to another carrier's flight (or opposite). The two biggest problems I experienced were a lack of a quick commuting transit system (like the mono rail at HK airport) which allowed me to cross different terminals quickly. Most of the transit desks were not operating and I needed to walk through all to see which one was available. On one occasion I arrived 1.5 hr before my connecting flight was scheduled to depart but the bus journey from parking bay to terminal took me 20min then I had to clear security and walk from T3 to T1 for transit which took me another 20 min. When I arrived at the transit desk at T1 check-in was close and I had to wait for the next flight (another 5 hr wait). This was not a pleasant experience.
Terminal 3 is a chaotic situation due to lack of signage and efficient staff at help desks. Usually help desk staff is disappearing. Situation gets even worse during short transit. A floor plan displayed various location may help passengers to locate themselves and fine their way to appropriate gates.
"Agree with many previous comments. Before T3 was opened Emirates were promising that it would solve all the problems of overcrowding at T1. However this has not proved correct. T3 has been poorly planned particularly as far as facilities are concerned. Nowhere near enough toilets or seats provided and the ""open plan"" Business lounge is awful and impersonal. If I had a long lay over I would be sorely tempted to head back over to T1. It's also worth noting that EK flights are still regularly landing miles away from the terminal and passengers are still having to be bussed which is a real pain. Whoever was responsible for this hugely disappointing building should not be given similar responsibility again!"
We arrived from FRA then connecting flight to KUL with Emirates (economy). In our opinion Terminal 3 is a mistake. I will be repeating myself with other reviewers. T3 is awfully overcrowded. Basic needs like sufficient number of clean toilets or seating places are not satisfied at all. You have to queue everywhere. We will avoid travelling with Emirates via Dubai at any price. I would recommend the same.
Transiting from the UK back to Australia with Emirates we taxied to a remote stand and were bussed into the terminal. Then escalators up two floors down one floor and then up 3 floors seemed crazy to get into a very busy and packed shopping mall. Dubai Duty Free is no more value than any other duty free. Toilets were small tight overcrowded and disgracefully dirty. Adding to that a lack of seating anywhere near a non-open gate (perhaps 100 seats for an A380 departure). Air conditioning set on freezing did not help either. Not impressed.
Terminal 3 is a new structure. The inbound passport control area is very big. I arrived from Istanbul at 12:40 am. There were 14 people in front of me at the waiting line at the inbound passport control. It took 50minutes to go through the passport. The passport police is extremely slow. On my way back from Cape Town I had to spend 7 hours for my connecting flight to Istanbul. I had to use the toilets 2 times. The toilets are very small there is always a queue. The mens toilets are also very badly used by passengers floors are flooded by people who do know how to use the toilet sprays. I prefer not to use this airport again.
Terminal 1. On arrival there was a long long walk to passport control and customs both of which were efficient. On departure check-in was efficient with no lines as was passport control and security. DCA lounge was bland with limited food and drink selections but was quiet. Duty-free was disappointing with limited selections.
I am also dissatisfied with the new T3 terminal. My main problem was the low temperatures of air-conditioning. It was in August and you had to wear a lot of clothes to hold it. I noticed that most passengers had the same problem and specially if you are on a transit flight and you are unprepared this can be a nightmare. Restaurant services in the airport are minimum and the toilets limited.
Terminal 3 too many gates and shops in the same place while other areas are so empty that seem completely devoid of life. I had a 14 hour transit and be sure that I spent almost all of them at the old Terminal 1.
This airport is easy to navigate around. Free wifi. Great shops with good prices and plenty of eateries. 
It began with a long slow queue for passports. The second queue was the first time through security scanners and a minor irritation as usual. Queue 3 was a second time through the security scanners and was maddening. I had to throw away my coffee. Shoes came off again. It was done so poorly it was a joke. The fourth queue was a customs machine and when that wasn't enough we were sent to queue 5 for a live customs agent.
"Arrived and departed this week using Terminal 2. I must say this is the best kept airport I have seen, friendliness and speedy operations throughout. A lot could be learned from this airport."
"Not impressed. Arrival to Dublin T2 appeared dull, dingy and not welcoming. Rather dreary colors and just depressing. Signage was just OK. Saw signs saying this was a new terminal just a few years old. Looked more like a terminal in need of serious work and an update. Not a great first impression of Ireland. Departure showed a different side yet the color scheme is horrid. Signage is pretty good. Pre-clearance to USA very odd but gets the job done. On a positive note, the immigration staff were pleasant. Overall Dublin airport does not rank very high on my list and I have been to many international airports."
"Terminal 2 is very modern with plenty of places to eat, particularly before security. The walks are short to the gates in T2 and toilets are modern and clean. Security queue times are relatively short and staff friendly and helpful. Terminal 1 is older and mostly good. There is a lack of places to eat in T1 but a new food market area is apparently opening in August. Walks to the gates in T1 are long compared to T2, particularly for Ryanair flights (Pier 1). Pier 1 is modern and clean but is basic in terms of facilities. The walk to Pier 3 is short but it is old and a bit grotty now.  The airport WiFi is the best airport WiFi I've used. You don't need to enter in any details and have unlimited time. There is an abundant supply of taxis at the airport so there rarely be a wait of more than a few minutes."
"Almost no queue for security, very quick. Good variety of places to eat, and excellent free wifi. Terminal 2 in particular  was very modern, and had an open and airy feel to it."
"Fast, efficient and polite fast track security. Good range of shops, facilities and places to eat."
"Very nice airport. Located in a very easy to reach area. The signs in the airport are not great. Other than that it is a very decent airport, the queues aren't long and the staff are very helpful. I look forward to coming here next month for my holidays."
Great airport. I booked my flights for the ideal time to get to the airport. I'd say from my experience that you need to get there two hours early check in online and you should be through security and everything in 10-15 minutes. The ideal times I think are from 6am to 9am and also 3pm to 9pm. I have travelled with Aer Lingus many times and their services are great with friendly staff. I really like travelling with Ryanair though because as long as you follow the rules you get a cheap flight and the staff aren't as bad as everyone makes them out to be everything is done with urgency and if you don't want any delays they are the best. I found that the airport staff are always happy and talkative and kind. Airport is spotless great facilities but could do with more toilets. Terminal 1 also needs a big makeover/modernisation. Overall I love this airport.
Arrived at airport at lunch time on 2 June. Departures was busy was through security and airside in 10 minutes. Staff were efficient and courteous and we were not herded like cattle as was my recent experience at Stansted. Well done!
Worse than Disneyland as far as waiting in lines. Was advised to get there early because of pre-customs but then the U.S. Airways desk not even open couldn't get boarding pass. Stood inline for over 40 minutes and then when they did open people I other lines were served first with no thought as to who had been inline first. Security was fairly fast but could airports please post a process list? I don't know if it's shoes on/off or your other rules so don't yell at me when I don't know. The pre-customs area is in some basement room. They weren't open yet no explanation as to why not? We were about 20th in line and by the time they started processing there were several 100 people in line. Despite the fact that we had JUST come through security had to do it all again and with different set of rules and go through that intrusive scanner machine. Then the passport check. Then back up to the gates except couldn't because the door to the stairs/escalator and the lift were locked. Again no explanation had to ask at the coffee kiosk (which wasn't open yet although by now it was after 8am) and was it was all European flights until a certain time. And what can't mix? Finally got up to our gate and only one coffee place with a huge line and not much time before our flight. Since there was no way we could've been through any of the processes any sooner any delay and we would have missed our flight. Guess you just can't fly to the U.S. from Dublin very early. They could certainly use some process improvement and a larger airport would help. With the impending sale of Aer Lingus it's bound to get worse. Will not use Dublin as a hub ever again even though I hate going through Heathrow.
Over one hour and twenty minutes delays at passport control in Dublin this morning and that was on a flight from London. Rude personnel. I will never use Dublin as my gateway to Ireland again.
Terminal 1. Was flying with Ryanair return from BHX a couple of weeks ago. Coming in to Dublin was quick and easy passport control took less than 5 minutes. Going back we were the last flight of the day anyway but then delayed by a further 2 hours making it about midnight before we were airborne. As such we had the Terminal to ourselves no queuing at all and staff at security were very good. Most of the shops had closed by then but from previous experience of Dublin Airport there's a good enough choice. Only complaints really is that it's a bit old and tired here and there ad there's a bit of a walk especially on arrival but nothing too much that bothers me. Overall a good airport.
US pre-clearance was fast and staff were efficient unlike many other airports I have visited. Terminal 2 looks very modern and although big it is easy to navigate. A large variety of cafes and stores were available and the airport was spotless. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.
The US pre-clearance process at Dublin is a disaster. The airlines have scheduled too many US flights at almost the exact same late morning time. As a result there are far too many passengers trying to get through security and US passport/customs control at the same time resulting in huge lines and terrible waiting times. We made it on time but our flight was delayed for 30 minutes to wait for a large number of passengers who didn't. Either the airlines should be forced to spread out their flight times or US pre-clearance should be discontinued in Dublin.
Regularly travel from Dublin airport. The new terminal 2 is bright and airy in the check in area. Much more pleasant than terminal 1 which is in desperate need of a makeover. Security at both terminals can be very slow. For US flights immigration pre-clearance is a huge advantage although staff there are very rude. (American though so cant blame Dublin for that). Selection of shops and cafes throughout the airport is poor. Often delays in taking off.
Went through Dublin airport on Sunday 21st December late afternoon. Arrived ahead of recommended 3 hours for our long haul flight. Check in and security took less than 10 minutes which was surprising given it was the weekend before Christmas. Everything was as it should be and there was a nice seasonal mood. Food hall offered a good choice of food and beverages everything was spotless. Was a really nice experience.
A perfectly modern and functional airport for the capital of Ireland. Plenty of shops eateries and other facilities before and after security. Staff polite and helpful airport well laid out and easy to navigate. The one criticism I do have though is the very long walk to the boarding gates the distances are quite energy sapping. The X1 coach service from Dublin to Belfast is excellent value for money.
The requirement to re-screen while passing through Dublin is ridiculous. On our way through to Glasgow from Chicago we had to clear passport control and re-screen even though we never left the secure area. On our way home to the US we had to re-screen through airport security and then do it all over again when we got to the TSA pre- screening area. What a phenomenal waste of time and resources.
I fly in and out of Dublin about twice a month. In general it's a good airport. Sometimes there can be monumental queues at the check in desks during holiday periods so I find it best to check in online (or using the numerous electronic kiosks) and then use the bag drop. T2 is the Aer Lingus terminal even though a number of its short haul flights leave from T1 so you go through T2 security and then walk for about 5-10 minutes. They will tell you it's a 20 minute walk but it certainly isn't. I know some people find this walk a pain but I occasionally will go through T2 security for a T1 flight (requires a smile and polite request to be let through) because at peak times T2 security can be faster than T1. There are some nice touches for instance the clear plastic bags for liquids are provided free of charge. Once into the scanning area you have to pick a random queue but in a year of flying in and out at different times I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes in T2. Even in T1 it's never that long. Paying for a fast track pass is rarely worth the expense in T2 as it only bypasses the boarding pass check - you still have to queue for the scanners with everyone else. Inside the terminal the facilities are not that great for the size of the airport. There's a real lack of seating in the main departure lounge and space is limited so it always feels cramped. Most of the seating is by the gates themselves. The shops and restaurants are only so-so. Overall I like it and I prefer T2 much more than the slightly shabby and dark T1.
Told to check in at T2 but then had to walk a long way to T1 to departure gate. On return had to walk back from T2 to T1 queue through immigration (just coming back from Scotland) and it took one hour from when we landed until we collected our luggage and went to look for the bus to the long term car park. Poor sign-posting and bus drops you at a different stop to pick. We'd parked near bus stop but then on our return had to drag our cases all the way across the car park. When we went to exit the number plate recognition wasn't working and the human attendant was slow and ignored us when the barrier wouldn't open. Dublin Airport gives no thought to people with limited mobility. Customers are forced to walk unnecessary distances and are forced through shopping areas making the walking distance even longer.
Went through Dublin twice on way to US and back on July 21 / Aug 16 2014. Massive queues at US pre-clearance on way out which were understandable if rather frustrating. Less understandable on return when trying to catch connecting flight to UK around 5am queued at Dublin for around 1hr 15min to get through passport and screening even though had done same on leaving Boston and had been in presumably secure environment since then. Hundreds in queue again connecting flights having to be held travellers beginning to panic as gate closure times being passed. Not a good advert for the airport with foreign visitors being especially unhappy first time have used this route and will think twice next time.
"Staff at the Terminal 2 security screening were rude and inattentive to passengers' requirements. As I was trying to remove my laptop from my bag a woman security officer kept shouting at me to hurry up; when I replied that I was trying to she responded in a supercilious tone with ""you have a nice day sir"". The security area was quiet with no queue behind me so why did she feel it was necessary to speak to passengers as if they were inmates at a correctional facility."
This is one of the dirtiest airports I have ever been in. A bit shocking since Ireland is generally very tidy. Someone needs to be hired to clean the restrooms and the food court area. There is supposed to be free wifi but it almost never worked. On the plus side the bus to the city center is good (and does have free wifi!) and there is a left luggage counter that is handy for long stopovers. Customs was also the speediest of any airport I have ever been in.
Great airport never any delays in my experience. wide range of shops and restaurants. Staff friendly and helpful.
As soon as the sun is a bit out T2 becomes like a solarium very stuffy and hot. Seats at the gate are dreadful. If you are lucky you are out quite fast on arrival and that is they only good point about Dublin airport.
I used terminal 2. It is a nice clean terminal and not too big. The check-in area is clear and efficient. The US immigration pre-clearance for US bound flights is a great service and means that you land in the US as a domestic flight - which is especially good if you have a connecting flight. I would try use DUB for this service alone. It is a pity that more airports don't offer a similar service. Be aware that there is no shopping and only very limited catering after US immigration so it is worth shopping and eating before the pre-clearance area if you need to. Luggage came out nice & quickly. Regional access to Dublin airport is good.
Flew into the new terminal 2 well we landed over at terminal one and then had a but tour of the whole of the airfield! It took us an absolute age just to get inside the terminal then you had quite a walk to get to passport control and baggage reclaim. Bit confusing on finding the pick up area too. Going back had its problems the terminal was like an oven and stared to feel unwell because of the stifling heat. Lack of staff at Aer lingus check in meant we had to queue for soem time but mercifully breezed through security. Another long walk to the gate along with the high temperatures not an enjoyable experience.
Flew in and out of terminal one check in easy security quite lengthy facilities airside much better than some previous correspondents have indicated. Walk to Ryanair gates quite lengthy not much seating at gate but generally a satisfactory experience.
Passed through terminal two on the way to the US on Thursday 6th March. It was a real pleasure - no check in queue yet the flight was full and no security queue despite the morning being the busiest time. US pre clearance is amazing and makes arrival in the US so much easier - wish Northern Ireland had it for the Newark flight from Belfast.
Terminal one is terrible - 30 minutes to get through security not at all clean only two eateries and one of those is a Burger King. It's hard to believe its part of the same airport as terminal 2.
I fly to and from Dublin airport at least 3x a month. Coming back into DUB T2 usually ok but only if plane does not stop at T1 gate. Leaving from T2 less pleasant usually. Queuing even through fast lane slow. In summer T2 is like an oven.
Literally the best airport I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. The service at the food hall was incredibly Huge inconsistency in services. Aer Lingus check in terminals in particular. 1 machine could not read a passport next could. Bag drop off consists of huge queues at peak times. Half the desks are empty and they prefer to have staff herding passengers around instead of checking them in. No other airport in the world finds it a normal process to have people working full time to pull people from the main queue for the closing flight queue as they know they will miss the flights. In T1 I used to just wait at the closing flight queue instead of waiting for nothing at the normal check in. Then generally if you are on a short haul you may have to walk to gates in T1 anyway. Once had our aircraft brought back to the ramp as they had departed minus 10 passengers due to delays in T2. Security has improved in timings in T2 and found that more organised now but watch out for Aer Lingus sharks monitoring the queue for oversized cabin baggage to send you downstairs again. Airside services are nice and if departing T2 terminal its a pleasant experience just painful to get there. Of course pre clearance for US flights is a great plus. For arrivals prepare to walk and if you arrive in business hours car hire consists of a mini bus to main yards 15 min away. So factor this in unless you go gold with the hire company. Also with car hire Dublin has extra charges for pick up (no clue why as pick up is away from airport) and excess is generally 3000eur.
Literally the best airport I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. The service at the food hall was incredibly quick less than 5 minutes to wait before it was on my table! The security was efficient and friendly unlike most airports. My phone connected immediately to their WiFi which really impressed me. It is a clean and neat airport that is incredibly user friendly. It made me love Ireland even more than I already did! Incredible!
Terminal 2 is a farce. A glorified check-in desk. You check-in in Terminal 2 and then have to walk miles to a departure gate in Terminal 1. I kid you not. Only in Ireland.
Normally use T1 several times a year not great (dated terminal) but never a bad experience. Expected great things from T2. Used it from BRX twice in the last 6 months. Arrivals ok departures an absolute mess. On both occasions we arrived at the terminal approx 90 mins before flight (not 2 early as we travelled with kids). The queues were shocking on both occasions we almost missed our flight. Second occasion we had to ask for help to get out of the queuing system so we didn't miss the flight. T2 might look pretty at 2am but should have been designed for purpose. Agree with other posts seems there are too many flights at certain times of the day particularly the morning. T1 all the way from now on.
"I fly through Dublin Airport twice a month security is always slow and security staff are generally rude and disorganised. I've seen security staff shouting at people to ""move on up the queue"" because it makes them look bad when there is a queue a mile long instead of opening more lanes they just treat people like cattle. Passport control - their answer to a big queue again is just to put more barriers up and make people walk around in circles instead of getting more lanes open! The toilets are usually really dirty."
We flew into Dublin (T-2) early morning (5.45 am) on a Saturday. Customs and immigration line was not too long and moved quickly. There is a convenient waiting area for those meeting rides tours etc. I didn't see a lot of the airport but what I saw was clean and well marked.
Terminal Two pleasant but seats in departures uncomfortable. Terminal two only a couple of years old yet cant cope with early morning long haul number of flights and passengers while Terminal One seems half empty. Arrived on long haul early morning on 31 March. Plane sat on taxiway for 20 minutes as no gate available then when at gate there was no one to operate the airbridge and sat another 15 minutes.
Unbelievable queues for everything in T2 this morning. Security is just awful - you queue to get on the queue. Many people running through the airport to try to make flights because it had just taken them such a ridiculous amount of time to get checked in and then through security. I think they have now just overloaded completely on the number of flights they are trying to depart between 6am and 8am. It was a really unpleasant experience all in all.
I've been through this airport three times in the past month. Arrivals were fine and we got quickly through passport control. For departures however security in Terminal 2 is still a mess. The problem with security in Dublin is a total lack of focus and organisation. Throughput must be much lower than at other airports but its not because the checks are better its because the staff are not focussed. The guys looking at the monitors are carrying on conversations with their colleagues and looking into space when there are no bags to observe because the said colleagues won't move the bags down the conveyor. The lead in conveyor is far too short as well. Its dire it causes unnecessary delays and I'm sure security must be weaker as a result.
Landed from Lanzarote in T2 late at night waited a long time for bags no other flights due in customs were standing watching everyone waiting on bags walked through with my husband asked where I was coming from and told to put my bags through the scanner. Customs staff were so rude not even a thank you.
Very clean and easy to get through facilities were amazing. I enjoy coming to Dublin airport but security is terrible and the queues are very long - it can also get very busy. Shops there are very good.
Flew EI for the first time in years so I used the new Terminal 2. (Normally fly FR) On arrival quite a lengthy walk to Passport Control but it was very swift. Waited no time at all at Passport Control and my luggage was already on the belt! Came out of the channel and the Arrivals Hall was very crowded and small made worse by a convenience store taking up so much space. On my return check-in was very quick and proceeded through the Arrivals Hall up another level to security. Security was very quick too. Terminal 2 has great shopping and refreshment facilities.
"A total nightmare. Arrived from Bilbao. Was told that transfer had closed. Had to exit re-enter and go through security. Queue was crazy with many people under pressure to get flights. I purchased alcohol at Bilbao and had Boarding Card and receipt I was told that I would have to dispose of it because it was not in a bag. When I asked a lady where Aer Lingus was she did not turn around and just said ""At the Aer Lingus desk"". Nightmare in comparison to the way I was treated at other airports."
I travel home to Ireland approx 4 times a year it's bad enough having to fly Ryanair but now we have the added waiting and queuing time at Dublin airport. I last travelled through after Christmas and thought that as it was the end of the festive holiday it could be a one off! But no I queued for nearly an hour to get through security there was absolute chaos people were getting stressed and constantly checking the time as the delays were impacting everyone! I would have assumed that more staff would now be recruited as it appears to be an ongoing issue! Dublin airport please sort it out!
Agree with previous posts. Dreadful delays through security - very slow and only 2 lines open. Felt like a complete disregard for customers. Won't use Dublin again unless have no other choice. All shops closed by 9.00pm so could not comment on facilities.
I am delighted to say that I used Dublin airport twice in the last month. The new terminal is very welcoming well planned and organised. It was good to see Irish language signs and to have a sense of arriving in a wonderfully welcoming airport. I found the use of art work and the theme of the 'gathering' to be very nice and both professional and sentimental. The airport seems to employ a lot of non-Irish people some of whom are very surly and let the airport and indeed Dublin down. The catering facilities are rather good but it is a puzzle that staff have a poor command of English. At a time of high Irish unemployment one would like to see Irish people employed rather than those with poor English and a bad attitude. Public transport is well signed and overall the airport is one of the best in Europe with attention needed to certain staff.
I fly regularly from the US to multiple cities in Europe. This is one of the most convenient and friendly airport that I flown to and connected from. The pre boarding US custom office is particularly convenient. There is a nice choice of affordable hotels with free transportation from and to the airport.
One word comes to mind - a disgrace! And nothing more! Arriving at T1 after a delay in Copenhagen I had to wait at least 30 minutes before I could collect my baggage as several flights had arrived at the same time and used one of the two operating baggage belts even though there were others not in use. Restaurant facilities are under criticism. Bad and over-priced food served by ignorant staff. None of the staff I encountered anywhere in the airport wanted to be there and this was reflected in the level of courtesy given. The staff at the information desk were by far the most ignorant! Flying out from T2 a week later the situation was only made better by a larger selection of food outlets. Security was a nightmare. No organisation at all with many queue jumpers and arrogant staff who just did not care. A major overhaul of the airport is necessary with greater attention being paid to employing staff who give a damn and to offering facilities that the traveller wants as opposed to what the airport wants the traveller to have.
Arrived with a Ryanair flight from Bristol. Half a mile walk to immigration very slow passport control took almost an hour with just 20 or 25 people in the queue. Staff completely indifferent. Poor signage no directions to public buses no information where to buy bus passes no good directions to other terminal. Airport looks modern but service is below zero.
We visit Dublin approx 4 times per year on trips to visit family and have never had problems until last two visits and on arrival it is now passport control that on arrival has large queue's and returning this time on the 30 Dec 2012 long security queue's plenty of lanes a pity only 4 were open it was no good a young lady shouting close up close up if there was nowhere to go I suppose it makes the queue look better on CCTV if you pack the people in closer.
Terminal 1. What an absolute shambles even at 6am on Saturday morning. Long queue and going nowhere quickly shouting orders at people and not in the least bit helpful. Having travelled to many countries even some non 1st world countries Dublin airport would rate very low. It's a real pity as once you get through the shambles that is security everything else is great.
All ok apart from queues at security not impressed. Hardly any machines open and queued for at least 20mins to get through. Such a shame as the last time I passed through here really smooth and efficient. No excuse for queues like that should be able to have adequate staff on at peak periods throughout the day.
"I don't normally do reviews but felt compelled to do this one after last night's experience at Dublin Terminal 1. I checked in for my flight about 1+1/2 hours before take off at 19.40pm. Going through check-in was a breeze but at security it was a nightmare. At the entrance to security are automatic doors which appear very new. At this point there was a little uniformed man barking out instructions to travellers like an RSM ""don't step beyond the yellow lines! wait your turn etc"". Passing though the automatic barriers you then had a very long zig zag queue of travellers. At this point I would hazard that about 45 mins had passed. If you had left it late as some passengers had you were going to miss your flight. The last section as always was the best bit and you had options which queue to join?! If like me you just accept that the queue you join will always be the slowest then no problem but if you're in a hurry! I got through okay and made my flight which fortunately had been delayed by 35 minutes. I am certain that many people missed their flights last night because of the delays in security. I think there is room for improvement at Dublin Terminal 1 but in the meantime would suggest that travellers check in early for flights."
"Ireland's busiest airport is an airport of long distances to walk especially when flying with RYR (definitely taken into account when proceeding to the gates). Complicated structure with two Terminals. Poor signposting at check-in in T1. Cleanliness in T2 is very good T1 is O.K. Accessibility by road is good but no rail link. There are good bus connections not only to Dublin city but also to the countryside even up to Belfast. However it's quite difficult to find the right bus stance especially since there are several services to the city with different tariffs. Recommendation: ""The Angels Share"" pub in arrival T1. Airside needs improvement but obviously a master plan is already in force."
T1 Security delay was an absolute disgrace on Sunday evening 11/11/2012. There were literally hundreds of people and only 3 or 4 security channels open. It took us 1 hr and 10 mins to get through and would have taken even longer had it not been for the kindness of several strangers who let us go in front of them as our flight was about to close. We had to run all the way to our gate with a young child in tow and got there with seconds to spare just as the flight was boarding. We saw several passengers at security who asked staff to let them through as they were going to miss their flights. The attitude of the staff was appalling they did not care and just told the passengers to get back in line. Many people must have missed flights that evening. My cynical side would say that it is a deliberate ploy by Dublin Airport to promote their fast track security service (at an additional cost of course).
Depart Dublin Terminal 1 around twice a month and always have a minimum delay of 20 minutes in Security. I have also missed a flight due to the delay in Security. When you ask the security staff why so few of the lanes are open they say it is 'down to management'. Would be interested in the reasoning behind this statement. Terminal 1 has improved greatly since Terminal 2 opened losing its 'bus station' feel with fewer passengers around. Food and drink facilities are ok. Overall if they resolved the unnecessarily long wait in security it would be a pleasant airport.
I was booked to fly back from Dublin to Bristol on Aer Lingus. We got on the bus to go to the plane (after passing security etc.) only to be told that the flight was cancelled because of bad weather. We were told we could try for a flight to Cardiff but would need to go back to the booking hall - about a Kilometre away. I got back to the booking hall and bought a flight to Bristol on Ryanair. The flight was in 40 minutes so it would be a rush to get to the plane on time. I tried security but it was solid with passengers so I asked the staff on duty if I could get to the front but they were having none of it. I stood in the queue for security for 25 minutes and then ran to the gate to find the flight had shut up 10 minutes before it was due to take off. I went back to the booking hall and changed my ticket for the later flight which cost me another 110 euros.
I don't understand the negative reviews. Arrived around 13.30 Tuesday October 9th and departed around 14.00 Friday October 12th with Aer Lingus from and to Amsterdam. Arrival the short taxi time was very convenient. Arrival and customs were very quick the new terminal looks amazing. Departure Checking in was very easy (on the machines) as well passport control was very quick once again and only had to wait in line for security check for about 5 minutes. Many stores and restaurants easy to find your way around screens updated very regularly sockets to charge your electronics free wifi.
We passed through terminal 2 again in August. The security screening has not improved at all. The entire operation is badly organised and run. The queues were long but moving only slowly so I had a good chance to observe operations on my gate and the one beside it. The picture was the same. Both X-ray screens were being read by girls who seemed to have attention deficit disorder - they could not stay still and despite the queues they were constantly leaving their posts to chat to other members of the crew. Whenever they saw something suspicious on the screen instead of getting their colleague to check the bag they called over the colleague from the belt to the screen and they had a discussion about the suspicious screen. In all cases they decided that the indication was safe and the bag was allowed though without opening. It looked almost as if they were being trained but that was not the case. Some simple changes to layout and work practices could improve efficiency and speed enormously. The rest of the airport was ok except for a 15 minute wait for some smoked salmon sandwiches at the bar there - it had to come from the kitchen apparently!
I am outraged by the security screening at Dublin airport. We arrived 2 hours prior to our flight and despite having no bags to check in we still missed our flight due to the huge queues at the security screening. Only 4 lanes out of 16 were open plus loads of people were pushing in. We waited for ages and due to being understaffed we missed our flight. Disappointedly we were then told we would have to pay €110 euros to catch the next Ryanair flight back. The man at the Ryanair desk also informed us that Dublin Airport purposely put the gate number up last minute in the hope that more people will spend more in the Duty free section and that this has also resulted in passengers missing their flights. This is a total disgrace and what should have taken me a few hours to get home resulted in taking 3 times longer and costing me 3 times the amount. Also with it being the summer holiday season and a Sunday why on earth were only a quarter of the staff working? I sympathise with many of the other passengers yesterday who also missed their flights.
T1 layout is poor and very congested around the check-in area. Check-in and security screening lines are quite long. Dublin Airport Authority charges 1-2 euro for a plastic bag for liquids and if you do not have the coins you have to try to find change. Long walks to many gates and shopping is very poorly laid out just after security gates in T1. If you are looking for your VAT refund you have to make your way to Terminal 2 after security which will take 30 - 60 minutes round trip providing there are no line ups at the VAT desk. When arriving in Dublin Terminal 1 security is usually quite good but a fairly long walk from the gates. The baggage reclaim area is very dull and depressing and the exit signs are extremely confusing. This is not very good as this terminal was renovated within the last several years.
"Changed planes in DUB a couple days ago. Upon landing it was very interesting to see grazing sheep cows and old farm cottages just beyond the airport perimeter fence instead of ugly industrial parks. T2 looks elegant clean and modern very impressive. Arrived from the US but had to clear immigration and ""enter"" Ireland in order to obtain connecting boarding pass to Dubai which was strange. All the airport staff were polite and courteous (including the local traveling public). The sole exception were the Polish women staffing the Emirates airline check-in counters who were extremely unfriendly and rude. Prices for food at the terminal were extremely high - comparable to Japan - so I did not buy anything. I wonder if main-street prices in Ireland are also this high? All in all transiting through T2 gives a very favourable impression of Ireland to the visitor and inspires one to pay a visit to this country."
Long queue at security but adjacent fast track security queue empty asked if I could use it but incompetent staff member declined the request. This staff manner is symptomatic of the decline in the country. Surely a can do attitude is better than a condescending negative attitude.
I live in Northern Ireland but prefer this airport over either of the ones in Belfast. I have never had any major difficulties coming in or out of Dublin. I agree with many that the queues are notoriously long but I accept that that comes with a busy airport and simply allow myself plenty of time! The upstairs airside food court is great if rather expensive and is a good place to escape the noise and crowds of other parts of the terminal and relax before your flight.
35 minute queue at security meant I almost missed my flight on Monday evening 25 June. We saw only one member of staff and asked about being moved forward but were told the queue was moving well. Only 5 of 16 channels open. The x-ray operator had to leave his post to check a man's bag there should be separate staff to do that to ensure everyone in the queue doesn't get held up. They should spend the money and get it sorted or lose custom. It was lucky that I was physically able to run 5 minutes through the terminal to the gate. All in all a dreadful experience.
As a regular user of Dublin airport (T1 and T2) I never had any major complaints until yesterday (June 18th). A young security staff member was barking at people to push their articles along the security belt despite the fact the belt was moving backwards! Rudely told me to remove my shoes (nobody else had to) when I informed her that my shoes don't usually cause security issues she shouted that they were randomly checking shoes. I dread to think what impression the surly attitude of T2 security gives visitors to Ireland. Otherwise airport works reasonably well.
Terminal 1 has become a dirty and unfriendly place to leave from our arrive into since the opening of terminal 2. The toilets leave much to be desired. Some security staff have no professional standards of customer care and seem to go out of their way to highlight a most unfriendly demeanour. The restaurants serve bad food at high prices. The DAA needs to get its act together by insisting its core staff deliver a better service to its customers.
Flew Dublin to Amsterdam on the first flight of the day (6am). The infrastructure in place in T2 is quite good but early in the morning it all took some time to some to life. As per the standard model for airport check-in the time was given as at least 3 hours before the flight time. This is all very well but the airport didn't really open until 1.5 hrs before. Once through security which was quite slow given the small number of people at that time we were through to an airside that wasn't offering much as nowhere was open yet except for one 'OK' cafe. For an airport of it's size it seemed odd to close down so completely and offer so little to travellers which had to be there at awkward times.
First time to transfer at DUB on 4 May second time on return 11 May JFK-DUB-NAP with Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus is now my choice transatlantic airline whenever possible. T2 breezy transfers courteous immigration clean and convenient with enough eateries and shops to keep me satisfied. Water not always running from faucets quite sparse in men's toilet. They have USA Customs pre-clearance which I did not benefit due to afternoon flight.
Terrible organisation at terminal 2 this morning 19 may with several passengers missing flights and staff completely overwhelmed by the situation. This is a reflection of management incompetence because it is due to a lack of planning and lack of proper management of resources to ensure passengers are ushered through in a professional way. This is not the first time this has happened indicating that management do not learn from their mistakes. There are many occasions where terminal 2 is a pleasure so it can be done. Respect for passengers should be higher up on the agenda. In situations such as this morning staff are rude while others treat passengers with contempt. A more competent management planning today would help to make flying a more bearable experience.
I recently went through the new terminal two. Security was chaotic. Staff were inefficient and the layout was terrible. For example the rollers for putting your bags on to go into security are only sufficient for a couple of people's bags meaning that everybody does they preparations (taking out laptops etc) right in front of the machine. With decent staff and a longer conveyor waiting times could be slashed. Incredible to think that this can happen in a new terminal. Apart from this the experience was ok. It does however give the impression that they built a shopping centre and tagged on the airport as an afterthought.
Frequently fly from Dublin Airport compared to other Airports its is very poor. Car Rental Pickup/Dropoff is nowhere near the Terminal. Security is unpredictable and poorly staffed there was a massive queue yesterday and still they only had one third of the Security points operating staff were rude. Factor in 3 hours if dropping back a rental car and its your first time at this Airport queues can be horrendous we showed up early due to the warnings on the radio of queues with the Bank Holiday weekend only to see that they hadn't even opened one third of the security checkpoints.
Allow 2hrs to get from the motorway to hire car drop off through check-in and then security. Hire car drop off is a mile from the airport no garages nearby and all traffic lights are set to stop you for 2 mins at every junction. Hire car buses drop you at arrivals not departures. When you've found the right half of departures to go to and hiked all the way there check-in goes reasonably well. Then it's onto security: Allow at least an hour of queuing. Prepare for rude operators and to have all your personal effects strewn over the conveyor until they tell you you're clear to go. After that it's a 20minute hike to your gate. Once onboard it's a 5 minute drive and 15 minute wait on the curtain before you finally get in the air.
Dublin T2 to Manchester quick check-in although Aer Lingus do the 'one queue for all flights' check-in. Plane away on time despite it being a packed Friday afternoon flight. Nice clean well laid out terminal and the Guinness no more expensive than central Dublin.
T1 Layout is poor and not up to the demands of the airport today. It all feels very cramped at check-in. Check-in times generally long despite operator choice. Security gates never fully manned - I have flown through many times and always have a longish queue - frustrating as this is cost cutting as there are security gates free but not manned. Dublin Airport Authority charges all customers 1-2 euro for a plastic bag for liquids. Long walks to many gates and shopping is sporadic and very poorly laid out just after security gates in T1. Baggage reclaim area feels dirty and looks depressed. On the plus shop variety and services are very good - expensive.
Excellent airport especially the new terminal 2. It was just built so is modern clean spacious and simple to use. Lots of shops and duty free nice places to eat and sit down. Terminal 1 is also great with many options for food and shopping although it's an older building - always clean and organized. The airport as a whole is excellent well located with plenty of parking spaces and bus routes and soon the new rail system will make everything even easier.
Use DUB frequently and now mainly T2 as Aer Lingus is based at this terminal. While I see some people complaining about having to go up and down-stairs numerous times I honestly don't see the problem. The terminal is bright airy and modern. I still can't get used to the speed of using this terminal and still arrive with so much time to spare with the entire process of getting from my car through check-in and security now taking an average of around only 15 minutes. Arrival is also a breeze.
Terminal 2. Apart from the aesthetic architecture it has little to recommend it. To enter the terminal from the car park you have to go upstairs one flight. Once you arrive in terminal to go to check-in you then have to descend one level. Once you have checked in you have to ascend two levels to go through security. Once through security there are the usual shops. To go to the gates you then have to descend two levels. It is a tragic failure of design.
I arrived in Dublin T1 midweek with Ryanair. I guess as with many airports that are geared to low-cost airlines you need to be prepared for a bit of a walk to immigration once you arrive. It's the same in departures and some of the gates are behind a one-way system which will not allow you to return to the shopping and refreshment areas once you've passed through. Dublin Airport doesn't have any kind of rail link or metro to the city centre. If you're not being picked up you will have to get the bus or a taxi. There are two very well publicised routes into the city. If I'm honest though my visit was pretty trouble free. I didn't really need to queue for very long anywhere other than to get on the flight and that was only delayed. There is plenty of space in this airport and I didn't feel like I was being herded like I often do at Bristol.
Used T2 several time's this year and every time has been fine. Checked in online and just walked in and put my bag in the baggage drop no queues. Most people complain about going up 2 levels and down a level (down two levels for US flights) but its not that difficult I think people are just looking for something to complain about. Security is quick A lot quicker than most other international airports and it was a busy Monday morning when I was flying out. The duty free is fine Not as big as T1 but big enough. Good choice of places to eat/drink with views over the airport. Pier E is spacious and clean the furthest gate is only a 10 mins walk if taking your time. Overall a very good terminal big improvement on T1.
The T2 I used for arrival and departure was clean tidy and very convenient in every aspect. On arrival immigration took about 7 mins then easy to find bus to the city. On departure security check was a breeze and then to the gate area with beautiful views of the apron. The building is and the facilities are nice. Food prices are higher than reasonable the airport is badly under used so not enough customers to run high street prices. Good facility. Easy to use. Duty free is somewhat Dubai like - very uninspiring.
Good architecture decent design for its purpose at T2 at least though emphasis on escalators makes departures a bit of a long haul. Horrific prices on almost everything even by usual airport standards.
Had to wait on the aircraft for 5-10mins before we were permitted to disembark. We were then channelled through a very narrow area en route to Passport Control where we were met with a staggering queue. This was a Sunday evening and yet almost two-thirds of the passport booths were closed and several flights were waiting. We then snaked around until we were directed to a booth. We were then faced with another narrow exit and into a cluttered cramped Arrivals Hall. Overall the airport is of an average standard with tatty Burger Kings and car exhibits taking up too much space. It was also several degrees too warm.
I write just to warn those dropping off rental cars so that they can then fly from Terminal 1: Ask the car hire agency in advance about drop-off location because there are zero signs on the airport circular road for T1 car hire return only T2. Otherwise I mostly like Dublin Airport
Can not see why people complain about walks etc no worse but better then many of the other airports I use this was the first time I have used T2 and was quite impressed no delays at security. but it was thorough. have used the airport twice in the past week with no problems.
Arrived at Terminal 2 on an Aer Lingus flight from UK. I expected to pick up the Dublin Airport Authority car park shuttle outside the terminal building as is the norm in any the majority of airports. Not in T2: you have to brave the elements go outside and drag yourself and luggage to terminal 1. No signs are on display to inform passengers no advance notice is given when making the car park booking. I rang DAA's customer service who were singularly unhelpful.
"Refers to terminal 2. Building is spacious no real complaints about departing. Problems however arise on arrival into terminal 2. We arrived from Amsterdam taxied to the gate and exited the planet he walk from the plane to the immigration area took 12 minutes we had to go upstairs downstairs along corridors one of which had a travelator (not working) - when we finally got to the immigration area the exit was closed. No one thought to open the shutter and we were left waiting there in a corridor like herded sheep with no air con and no windows - after a 10 minute wait some passengers became enraged and started to pound on the shutter this had the desired effect and after a 5 minute pounding the shutter was eventually opened. At least 3 employees of DAA who were asked for an explanation just shrugged their shoulders and said it ""wasn't their fault"". Thankfully the process through immigration and customs was fairly swift. However when we exited terminal 2 and had to walk half a mile to terminal 1 to get the bus back to the car park. DAA have let Ireland down with this very poor service. I for one will never travel through terminal 2 again."
Used Terminal 2 for coach class flights on EI to and from Chicago in May 2010. Very pleased with the airport. Using Aircoach we were at our friends apartment on the north edge of Central Dublin within 60 minutes of landing. Immigration and baggage claim was fast. Terminal 2 was open and spacious. We returned to the airport to pick up a rental car which was in the garage from Terminal 2 - a short walk. Note that you will return your car elsewhere - near the entrance to the airport - and have a bus ride back to the terminal. Check in was fast and US immigration lines were fairly short. You do go through customs even though you've checked a bag - you'll see a picture of your checked bag. Once through US customs there's only one small snack bar and tiny duty free so you may not want to go through too early. Before US customs a good choice of shopping and eating options. Main terminal is spacious although the US holding area is kind of cramped. Arrival in US was as if from a domestic flight even though we arrived at international terminal at ORD. It was very nice not to have to go through customs and immigration upon arrival in the US - and this would really be helpful if connecting in the US I think. I was pleased with DUB terminal 2.
Very efficient self check in stands fast check in. Good facilities for shopping coffee shops clean and tidy. Good public transport to city centre - however after 21.00 all eateries were closed!
My flight dropped me at Terminal 2 recently. It took me a very long time and after asking many people before I could find my car rental desk in Terminal 1. I was directed hither and thither by Information and other miscellaneous staff. The signage for Terminal 1 in Terminal 2 is virtually non-existent (there is one tiny sign which is hard to spot). There is a long walk from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 (and vice versa). Terminal 1 appeared to be virtually deserted. I don't understand why Departures and Arrivals are on upper floors of Terminal 2. I was too exhausted by the early morning start and all the walking and Security to bother with the shops when I finally got through to the Departure Hall.
Since T2 opened I've used both terminals regularly and I've found the experience to be pleasant and hassle free. The airport is clean and queuing seems to be restricted to the busy morning period only. Terminal 2 in particular is an absolute pleasure to use with short walking distances from check-in to gate.
Just flew in and out of terminal 2 for the first time. When you collect your luggage you have to get an elevator or escalator to access taxis. Fine with one bag but difficult with golf clubs or stroller and especially the elderly. On departure i went up and down 3 escalators to eventually go through security for a second time as I was travelling to US. Not sure it is as passenger friendly. No time to stop and browse in stores.
Dublin airport is a nice partly clean airport but the check in hall is badly organised and everyone is running around trying to find their check in desk. The rest of the airport is ok the food isn't the full shilling. On the other hand terminal 2 is brilliant I have flown to Boston numerous times and there is no queues or hassle.
Used the new T2 for the first time this weekend. Bright and empty. I saw no queues. Signage adequate. Food options only okay especially once you get past security where the coffee is horrific. Still T2 doesn't solve DUB's main problem which is that it has no rail transport link to the city centre and that the Airlink costs EUR6 one way. (There is still the 16A which takes ages but costs EUR2.30.)
"Dublin to Brussels yesterday morning at 06.40 Terminal 2. What other people say is spot on: the place is huge but badly laid out and the queuing times are awful. For instance we were directed to the far-left queue but with the ""fast-track"" lane joining there the line of people became very long. Allow yourself 40 minutes to get through security in time. Things did not improve on return (21.45). Only two people checking passports for EU flights when I could see that flights from half a dozen major European cities were scheduled to arrive within 30 minutes of each other - meant a delay of at least 20 minutes at Passport Control when all people want to do is get home as quickly as possible. I agree with comments that staff need a lesson in customer care. They're all far too serious and jobworth. My first visit through T2 was a negative one."
Terminal 2 a disastrous lay out. Dreadful signage and security personnel. Air travel is just getting worse and worse based on my experience here. The place itself is far too big for the traffic it handles and seems to be a complete waste of money. But the security personnel really take the biscuit. Training in how to treat passengers as human beings rather than cattle would help.
Dublin airport (now 2 terminals) is one of the strangest airports. Terminal 1 I use a lot. It was designed (and operated as) a multi-storey car park. The access ramps are still there and can be seen when arriving landside (facing the Terminal 2 building) - so no wonder that it has its drawbacks. Pier D light spacious and with some design flaws mainly relating to layout is fairly OK and of international standard though not excellent in any significant way. It is far removed from terminal 1 by curved walkway which does not have enough travelators. On the inside of this curve there is the original (beautifully restored) terminal from 1939. Gates A/C baby changing facilities are well below standard - better off not using them. Another very negative thing is security checks - most of the x-ray machines are often switched off so only part of the capacity is used - they rather see long queues than spend a few euros on efficiency. In this day and age you often have to take off shoes belts etc. There are no spaces to sit and put your shoes back on instead right after security you find yourself in the shopping area. Terminal 2 promises to be better laid out but those flying budget airlines (myself included) will remain stuck with terminal 1. Any complaints about it you should have just paid the higher price for an other airline that flies from the new terminal. Absence of airbridges is on insistence of budget carriers because boarding is quicker without the airbridges and decreases turnaround time. Gates A and C do have airbridges but not used on all flights.Shopping/food value far too expensive. Pier D is a 25-30 minute walk (even if young and fit) - no caddy service no hand luggage trolleys. Other than that Pier D is the more spacious.
Security is a nightmare at Dublin. Despite arriving in good time for our flight we spent an hour waiting to go through security. Only four of the security stations were in use despite the airport being mobbed. Consequently we had to rush the long haul to the Ryanair departure gate and only just managed to catch our flight.
Ryanair departure area is a long walk before you get to passports and baggage reclaim area. The volume of passengers is way down on the boom years so it isn't so congested.
I find Dublin a very frustrating airport in many respects. Arrived at what I consider to be the original part of the airport and it is extremely tired and user unfriendly for less able passengers. As usual long wait for the bags - 45 minutes - I have a theory that they prioritise Aer Lingus flights. Departed from the original part of the airport - lacking in space. The new terminal looks impressive hopefully the bags will be deposited a lot quicker in it.
Dublin Airport has a very crowded security area. There are two at either end of the check in area (and either end of the shopping corridor airside) and are usually queued way out towards the check in desks again. Security staff can be a little rude at times. Once you're through security you're straight into the shopping area which is a very cramped long corridor with many expensive shops and lots of hand luggage rolling around. No seating until you get to the relevant Pier. I have flown mostly from Pier D in recent years and it is actually very good. It is spacious and quiet and has some cafes and shops along it. The last time I flew they still had some of the portacabin pier left (you go through a gate a Pier D which actually just brings you downstairs to the horrible bit) and its like you're standing in a caravan its very very cramped noisy and hard to hear the announcements. Very busy during the delays 2 years ago after the ATC meltdown! Landside there is a good selection of cafes and restaurants on the mezzanine above check in. Beware though all the lifts (except pier D) seem to be quite dodgy especially the ones out at the car parks even the newish lifts at check in sometimes don't work!
Getting to and from the Dublin airport is still bad but once there it's fine. I have occasionally seen the queue for security spilling out round the departures lounge but normally you get through quite quickly albeit they never use all available scanners. The choices for eating and drinking have improved over the years and pier D even if a long walk away is still a huge improvement on the awful portakabins that they had before.
"Loads of good views of the apron from the airside. Catering and retail options in all areas of the airport are very good. The DAA pay as you go ""Anna Livia"" lounge is well stocked tidy and value for money. Dublin Airport can be heaven or something less than depending on the time of day and the gate you depart/arrive from. Then opening of T2 later this year will improve things massively."
"Since my last post I've used Dublin four more times and still quite satisfied. Departing or transferring passengers should know that once you enter some concourses (""A"" for sure and possibly others) you may not be allowed back into the rest of the airport. Arriving passengers connecting to long-distance bus or rail should know that the direct buses to the downtown intercity bus terminal and Heuston rail station are the 747 and 748 respectively (Connolly passengers can take the light rail from outside Heuston). These are green double- decker buses which will be on your left exiting the terminal; they cost 6 euro each way. Having used Dublin 6 times now I find it quite satisfactory and will continue to use it in the future."
Agree with the last review. Construction site appearance but still functional. Check in good and security quite quick. A bit of a walk to get to the A gates but nothing too bad. Plenty of seats for waiting departure. Overall satisfactory. AirCoach to city is E7 which is dear but fast. Bus at E2.20 is good value but takes at least an hour.
Massive construction underway but not (as yet) inconvenient to passengers. Flew out of DUB at peak time early Friday evening and the airport was functioning well
Dublin low-price terminal (Ryanair etc.) really has improved. Still a long walk to/from customs/immigration but - on departure - once you have got clear of the crowded shopping bazaar things really improve.
The international arrivals area is somewhat spread out eg. a walk down a narrow hall to passport control than again to customs etc. There were no lines or delays. The arrivals level of the terminal is dark but signage is clear and my bag came reasonably quickly. There are good bus connections to and from the airport although you want to know which one you want beforehand. All in all clean and functional but nothing outstanding.
I fly to/from Dublin Airport regularly and find it to be a pretty good airport albeit one that is undergoing needed improvements. There is plenty of space and security is generally pretty fast and efficient. My main bugbear is the length of time it takes to get to pier D especially the far reaching gates.
Dublin Airport is improving. Next year Terminal 2 will open. I left Dublin for Amsterdam and Aer Lingus still operates some flights from the future low cost pier D. That was a long walk indeed but the area is pleasant with abundant seating and facilities. There are no airbridges there boarding is via the tarmac. I assume that when Terminal 2 opens pier D will be given over to Ryanair and other low cost flights entirely and the walking distances for scheduled flights will become shorter again.
DUB continues to be a traveler's nightmare. Departing from D pier is a particularly horrible experience because of the very long walk. We made the mistake of eating Burger King at the new Terminal 1 Extension – it was so slow we gave up after 15 minutes although at no time were more than 3 people in front of us! The extension itself is very nice although the whole airport smells of one big toilet - I think it is the 'cleaning product' that is used/sprayed in the toilets. Please DAA do something about this (and the other 100 or so problems with your airport).
"A nightmare checking in at peak periods and as others have stated an outrageous walk to pier D. Security on the way in is usually quick (as is passport control coming back). Now benefits from a new large duty free shop on the way to Piers A/D. Unfortunately you have to negotiate the ""alleyway"" after clearing security to get there and the price of goods is a laugh. Parking is the most expensive I've seen at any airport (and I've been to a few). All in all main terminal is a tired old building too small for it's purpose. Pier D is acceptable (assuming your flight doesn't depart from the portacabins below it) albeit too far for young/elderly/infirm passengers to walk. The new terminal can't come soon enough."
Terrible airport to make connections! We were herded like cattle into long hot hallways to go through EU customs. We watched our departure time for the connection come and go and there was no one we could talk to!! Fortunately Air Lingus held the flight for us - but we had no way to know that at the time. The airport is set up to require very long walks (or runs) to make connections with wheel chairs being the only way to get assistance. Terrible design.
I fly from Dublin about twice a year and find it so annoying Its not so bad during winter and off peak seasons but during the summer its terrible. You walk in the main entrance and it is packed. Security is quick and no hassle to get through. Duty free isn't really duty free considering that its dearer than shop outside the airport. It depends on what pier you go to. different piers have better quality I remember walking for about 15 mins down a huge never ending corridor of prefabs to get to my Ryanair flight and when I got there it only had 1 shop which sold over priced beverages. On the positive side of Dublin Airport its easy to find where you are going and staff are friendly.
Recently had a pleasant transfer on the way from Aberdeen to Bournemouth with Ryanair. The airport was quite efficient with reasonably friendly staff. All quite busy. On previous visits the bus transfer was edging on pricey ( for what it is - a cold steamed up double decker) and subject to alot of traffic delays. Although Ryanair flights mainly pass through Area's A and D these areas are not as nice as where BA and other airliners depart. Gate B I think has a drinking fountain OK seating and excellent views of the taxiways and runway if staring out the window is what floats your boat. The airport seems to lack much in occasion I would certainly rather fly from LHR to further away destinations. On a well commented side-note do not leave a tight connection in DUB. I got my aging parents to connect on way to Glasgow from Palma and they had to run the marathon from Gate D back out of the airport and back to check-in which was shocking and they missed their flight by 1 minute. It is common for connecting passengers and my parents recieved no help had to run with no shoes and then stay in an awful hotel outside the airport. They will never use it again so if connecting beware but generally a fine airport.
"It all depends on where you are going but it does not really matter because it is all bad. The airport is very badly connected which is a huge failing and is totally unacceptable. No direct metro or train and so is very inconvenient. Reasonable sort of distance from the city so that is ok. Parking is hideously expensive and so are taxis so that is not good. As you have no other choice of airport you screwed so buckle up and get on with it.. The place is a building site at the moment with new terminals springing up on top of old ones. Check in Hall is old and tired but works except at peak times when it is bedlam. Security is actually good pleasant and efficient - so top marks on that score. The airside is chaos - the ""mall"" just inside security is diminutive narrow and very lacklustre frankly bad. there are too many useless over priced retail outlets and not enough food options. If you travel from pier B it is close but the arrangements they have for US flights are cattle like. Do not go down until you absolutely have to. Pier C is fine though with insufficient seating. Pier A is quite distant and really dreadful in terms of facilities of any sort. Pier D is somewhere in France and is disappointing when you get there after such a long walk. Arrivals off the plane. Bad at the outset because except from Pier B you have miles to walk and in Pier D's case a couple of counties. Customs are efficient and the baggage hall is shocking in the extreme and the best part is that you can stroll out quickly but then you no way of getting into Dublin."
At first I felt like I had stepped back into the '50s upon entering the Customs and Immigration area at Dublin Airport. However any negative first impressions were erased by the speed with which I was able to get from the aircraft to the arrival area just in time to catch an Airlink bus into central Dublin. Boarding and disembarking from flights required walking across the tarmac so be prepared for this if it's raining in Dublin - a common occurence.
Checked in online so no problems there. Lots of building work being done but security process was reasonably swift and painless. Plenty of retail outlets flightside but no sign of a newsagent. Very long walk to departure gates but overall not a bad experience.
Dublin has come on in the last number of years with infrastructure changes (construction of T2) security improvements and the choice of bars and shops. However many number of things are still lacking. The main check-in area is an absolute mess with people trying to navigate from one side to the other. Quality of foods in some of the 'restaurants' and ridiculous pricing of same are a disgrace. I think the DAA officials should take a trip to airports like Singapore-Changi to see for themselves the range of passenger comforts and most especially space. Space is what is needed.
A very good airport that seems well equipped to cope the traffic it receives (admittedly it was fairly quiet when we arrived and departed). There was a 10 minute wait to have passports checked on arrival but apart from that everything was very efficient and easy. The bus service to the city is cheap and convenient but be aware it runs according to the flight schedules rather than a regular timetable so you need to check the day before your departure. Also it does not pick you up where it drops you off on arrival (the tourist office will give you the information you need). A nice airport serving a wonderful city.
I arrived at this airport. It was the most efficient passport control and luggage retrieval experience I have had. Within 10 minutes of landing I was outside sitting on the bus to town accompanied by my checked luggage.
A lovely little airport with a newly built and quite stylish looking terminal. Very efficient for both arrivals and departures and no hold ups at all though it did seem pretty quiet both times. Everything is well signposted and retail outlets appear sufficient and spacious enough for the numbers using them. Staff encountered spoke good English and both kunas and euros were happily accepted. There is very limited seating before security but plenty airside. A nice and rarely seen touch is a dedicated smoking lounge airside this alone is worth 5 stars! The roads leading to the airport at least from the north follow the coastline and though very scenic do not lend themselves to high speeds. I had arranged transfers through my hotel and can't comment on taxi or bus services but a 30 minute journey from Dubrovnik given no congestion seems reasonable. All in all a good experience.
It looks like the airport terminal is currently in the middle of a much needed expansion program. Arrived at the same time as one other flight and there was absolute chaos in the tiny baggage reclaim area as there were too many people in the available space and the monitors above the carousels didn't show which one was being used for which flight. Departed at the same time as another three flights and while it was easy to get through check-in and security both of which were fairly spacious the gate area was extremely cramped. It was also impossible to hear any announcements there due to the echo and the noise generated by several hundred other people.
We use Dubrovnik airport 2 or 3 times a year. It is light airy and as far as we are concerned friendly. Compared to such places as Esbjerg and Charleroi it is a luxury. The duty free is mind blowing - 200 cigarettes for £10 and Cuban white rum about £7 per litre. For some holiday makers I daresay the lack of fast food outlets is a major drawback!
Have arrived in July 04 afternoon - however landing runway in not top condition terminal fully reconstructed after war fast luggage unloading but very tight space especially for peak times due to increasing incoming in season an low-cost boom. No space for passport cues forces police to work fast. Nearly no public bus connection into city (3 times a day !) only taxi for 30 Euro (25 km). By departure tight space by check-in (one or two counters maximum per flight only BA 3 counters). Nearly no seats to wait or watch planes - only two large restaurant bars force you to sit there and spend money. There are 7 gates but you must wait until you are announced to pass security as the 1-4 are separate from 5-8 where also three duty free shops are located. Prices reasonable and cheaper than departure hall downstairs (especially for spirits). Very strict and unfriendly security by state policemen access to planes by walk or bus. Good point to discover southern Croatia Montenegro or Bosnia.
This is a relatively pleasant airport to use even though its facilities may be rather limited certainly for those departing on domestic flights. Check in is undertaken by staff whose strength lies in their efficiency rather than the warmth of their service. Be advised: check in staff are zealous to detect any batteries in checked luggage. Luggage is screened for any offending batteries and will not be despatched until they are removed. Waiting facilities at the gate are spartan but adequate. It's better to wait for as long as possible in the large restaurant before boarding one's flight.
Excellent airport having recently done a roundtrip from Dundee to Birmingham. It is really convenient for those working in and around Dundee with reliable flights from both Flybe and Cityjet (Air France). If you need to get away from Dundee Birmingham and London are ideal for onward connections and you don't have the hassle of having to drive to Edinburgh pay for parking and the long check in times. Here you can check-in 30-40 mins prior to your flight.
Beautiful views on take-off free long-term parking nice friendly efficient staff and so convenient if you live between Edinburgh and Aberdeen. But does it really have to be so prohibitively costly for the non-business and small business traveler? The dreary trek to Edinburgh by train and bus or even car adds 2 hours but saves hundreds of pounds. When's Easyjet coming to Leuchars? Air France needs some competition.
Dundee Airport provides a convenient link direct to London City Birmingham & Belfast. The airport is small and there are no shops. There is a Costa coffee stall and the airport terminal is modern and comfortable. I would recommend flying from Dundee Air France now provide the Dundee to London City route and Fly Woosh the Birmingham & Belfast services. My only gripe lies with the airlines themselves who do not seem to realise that if they lowered their weekend prices they could cash in on a lucrative leisure market which is put off by the high prices. Dundee to London route is only worthwhile for leisure if booked way in advance and you can fly out with peak periods.
Flew out of Dundee Airport for the first time (even though it is our home town when we are back for the summer holidays). Friendly check-in staff and understanding security staff. Yes it is a small airport and lacks the faciilities of say Edinburgh and Glasgow. But after the 'Glasgow' incident it was refreshing to drive to an airport and not suffer the issues encountered at other BAA airports. The takeoff to London City provides a fantastic view of the Tay. Will use it more often.
Dundee Airport is very small but has a modern terminal building. Facilities are not suprisingly rather limited but the check-in is very quick and easy. Free parking is available. The only route is the Scot Airways service to London City Airport which operates several times daily. The only negative aspect is the lack of public transport links but a taxi ride to the city centre takes only five minutes. The main Aberdeen-Glasgow railway passes the airport - the lack of a station is annoying. Compared to the long queues and delays at larger airports the tiny Dundee Airport is a delight to use and a useful alternative to Edinburgh or Aberdeen airports. The view of the city and the River Tay on takeoff/landing is stunning.
DUD is a small but efficient airport with everything you need. Landed from Wellington bags out very quickly. The airport is quite far from city centre (30-40 mins) cost nearly 100 dollars by Taxi and 30 dollars by super shuttle. Departure is well organised check-in sufficient airline lounge is located upstairs security check right before you board.
Think it only has a dozen flights or so a day exclusively under the Air NZ banner now Freedom Air is being re-amalgamated into Air NZ. It has been well modernised and seems very spacious. It has the advantages of a small airport with short distances plane to terminal to baggage collection and to car park. We were in the car and off within 10 mins of getting off the lane. On departure there is a great upstairs light and airy waiting/eating/ arrivals area with plenty of space and excellent views. There are adequate drinks food and shop. The only downside was that the hire car companies closed quite early so as we were arriving at 9.00 pm we had to persuade friends to come and collect us.
Landed 08H00 from CPT and out in 10mins as no baggage. Long walk as aircraft parked far. Very nice and clean airport. Really like the wide choice of outdoor restaurants in the garden. P/up and go vehicles move fast. Police and security officials visible.
A fantastic new airport that is miles ahead of the old Durban International. Bright spacious and with a feeling of quality.
The new King Shaka airport is roomy airy and thoughtfully planned. There are a dozen or so retail outlets on the ground floor accessible to all and more retail outlets past security on the second floor where check-in occurs. There was an airport shuttle service connecting the airport to downtown Durban (and some coastal points along the way) that was reliable going into town but not coming back. Not sure if this is a regular service or if it was only during the World Cup.
Durban is a very nice airport. I took a connecting flight on Mango airlines to Johannesburg. It was nice clean and well laid out The Spur on the top floor has a great view of the tarmac and runway. Remember that to get to your flight there is no entry ramp but you have to walk outside onto the tarmac to walk the stairs onto the aircraft.
I have recently travelled out of Durban International enroute to Sydney and was most pleased with the efficiency of the system and the warm friendly attitude. I am not sure of the extent of the airport upgrade but would certainly like to see more international flights land there.
Returned from Cape Town in February after a lovely holiday and waited quite a while for my luggage. I thought the service at a small airport like Durban should be faster in delivering baggage to the carousels. The options of restaurants / quality of food leaves much to be desired. Building work for a new car park at the airport has caused quite alot of chaos on an already cramped drop-off area and available parking space but is desperately needed.
I have travelled out of the new and improved Durban International Airport and I am pleased to say that is a really nice airport. The whole atmosphere of the airport gives you an Aquarium feel. Got a good range of shops both before and after security so generally a good experience overall.
Durban International has improved vastly since a much needed recent upgrade. It now has a really nice clean and spacious feel. Staff are generally friendly there's a good range of shops and eating places and the big indoor palm tree's and tropical fish tank create quite a soothing atmosphere. Domestic connections seem to be very good but there are limited international flights.
Customer service has deteriorated significantly since my last trip in Jan. I arrived to catch KL1534 on 27 March 2012. Check-in agent said she could not tag my suitcase through to my final destination claiming that a routing of 4 flights cannot be printed on a single tag. I have taken many 4 flight journeys in the past with a single bag tag printed at the starting airport. I suspect that the real reason is that doing so involves some complication and that she just couldn't be bothered. The airside gents' toilet stank of sewage so badly it was impossible to set foot in there. Finally there was no priority boarding for Skyteam Elite members on the KLM flights: boarding was done by everyone stampeding for the gate queue as soon as the flight was called. If this airport wants to survive let alone continue charging passengers a £6 departure fee which its rivals in the region do not it needs to start running a much more professional operation.
I flew from MME for the first time in almost a year largely because the cost of KLM tickets to a long haul destination have for some reason become more expensive than their equivalents from MAN. This time however there was only about a £60 difference between the MME-AMS-SEA-BUR flight compared to going from MAN and I thought that was worth paying for the convenience and absence of queues that MME offers. On the outward trip at least it was. Apart from the KLM flight I boarded there was almost no traffic at all (I get the impression the loss of charter and holiday flights due to the recession must have hit MME hard) and it remains one of the most stress-free airports I've ever used. There was one irritation. The Iceland volcano business started while I was away as a result of which my return was delayed by four days. While I was away I emailed MME telling them that my car would overstay its paid-in-advance booking in the airport car park asking them not to clamp it or have it towed away and asking if I'd be liable for any extra charge. Don't worry your car is safe and no extra charge came a very quick reply. However when I did return there were no airport staff around anywhere to get my ticket validated and I had to pay an extra £38 in the machine to get out of the car park. I later wrote to the airport enclosing the receipt and asking if they'd consider refunding me. It's now two months later and I've had no reply. Admittedly this is a very minor problem compared to the volcano disruption some people experienced but given that MME must be having real problems retaining routes and passengers (not surprising given how much the cost of KLM flights from the airport have gone up) I didn't find that very impressive
I should report good news. On a recent flight to AMS my pre-printed boarding pass could not be read by the scanner at security and I was dealt with (as were other passengers in a similar situation) very brusquely and rudely by a couldn't-care-less it's-everybody-else's-fault-but-mine attendant. On my return I wrote a letter of complaint to the airport manager received an immediate acknowledgement and within a few days a detailed and thoughtful apology not just a standard half-hearted general fob-off. Excellent PR which I applaud.
I have used this airport much more regularly since my previous comment and cannot fault it as a quick departure/arrival point. I flew in from AMS on Saturday afternoon and even with hold luggage to collect was driving away in my car just 12 minutes after touching down. There aren't many facilities and the staff are willing in a slightly amateurish way rather than polished in PR techniques but who cares when progress through the terminal is so quick and easy? Let's hope it doesn't grow too quickly for its own good!
First time used MME for a holiday charter flight (to Paphos) though used MME many times before as feeder to either AMS or LHR. All very efficient though agree with previous comment about making use of shops and cafe/bar before going thru security. On return baggages arrived in arrivals hall before we did even though B737 800 series plane was full with about 190 pax. At Paphos airport departures still called in Teeside (sic) as do most people me thinks. Signposting at airport could be better during current refurbishments though overall experience superior to NCL.
I agree with both previous comments. Although my most local airport I used it for the first time only this week to fly out to LUX via AMS (with KLM) then back from BRU via LHR (with BMI). I was on the road barely 10 minutes after landing on my return (hand baggage only) but had some trouble checking in at Brussels where the staff still referred to the airport as Teesside then again passing through passport control at Heathrow when I gave Teesside as my destination and was told somewhat sharply (and lacking any humour in tone or body language) by the man on the desk that there was no such place! Seriously road signs must be a real pain for strangers to the area - why on earth can't quick stick-on amendments have been made by now? Overall however a pleasantly small and efficient operation - although like Leeds/Bradford (of which in many ways this is a smaller version) passengers will need to be prepared to get very wet and/or cold when joining or leaving aircraft in poor weather.
I use this little airport for flights between northern England and SE Asia via AMS on KLM. I find it a very convenient feeder airport to the AMS hub and the small size of the terminal ensures that arrivals are swift and painless - I'm on the road within 15 mins of hitting the tarmac in most cases. Staff are generally friendly and helpful. By contrast nearby NCL - which used to be very quick and efficient - is much more hassle with some of the most miserable ground staff in Europe.
Finding this airport can be confusing because it recently changed its name from Teesside to Durham/Tees Valley. Signs on the main feeder roads (i.e. the A19 A66 and A1M) have not all been updated so look out for either. There is a free bus to and from Darlington rail station but it takes a while and is only hourly outside peak times. At the time of writing (12 May 2006) a new terminal building is under construction. The temporary entrance is on the west side of the existing terminal and again is not well signposted. This airport's major strength is that because there are only one or two flights coming and going at any time there are never any massive queues. You'll get through security and (for incoming international passengers) customs and immigration a lot quicker than at NCL or LBA. The long-term car park is significantly cheaper too. There are self-service check in machines for BMI flights to Heathrow and desks for all other flights. If you want something to eat before your flight I suggest getting it at the pub or café BEFORE going through security as the only airside food outlet does pretty grim reheated sandwiches and not much else. Ditto for newspapers/books/magazines - there is a W.H. Smith in the check-in area but not the departure lounge (but it does have a bar and a duty free shop). If there's nothing in it price-wise I would always fly from MME in preference to LBA or NCL because it's a very quick airport to get in and out of
After going through a nightmare in Tashkent airport I was expecting to face something similar in Dushanbe. I was surprised - in a positive way. Yes the airport is old no facilities but - it took me 15 minutes to get the visa another 15 to go through passport control and once I finished with that my suitcase was already waiting for me. No custom forms to fill out only a short immigration form. Thinking that this may have been an exception I arrived to the airport 2 hours before my departure. 5 minutes for check in no queue in passport control and literally a minute in security check (no one cares about things like liquids taking out laptops etc.). Which left me with more than an hour and half in the terminal where there is nothing to do. A small duty free (expensive) and a small bar are the only things for entertaining no wireless of course. Overall not bad at all. The new terminal building is supposed to be ready this fall.
Welcome back to the 1950s! Soviet era customer service and chaos. Dushanbe only has 2 flights a week from Istanbul (most flights are from Moscow) - if they had more the system would collapse. On arrival it took 3 hours to clear immigration - once I got my visa I had to wake up the border official to stamp my passport! Usual FSU customer service standards - it took 20 minutes from getting to the desk to receiving a boarding card with the check in agent calling her friends and wandering off during check in hand writing passenger details carry your own bag through the scanner etc. They relieved me of $40 exit charge for which I got no receipt so I am not sure if this was simply a bit of Tajik private enterprise or a tax on foreigners. Airside there is absolutely no space - the airport was designed before security measures and you simply have to wait until 5 minutes before the flight before you go through. Duty free closed (with only 2 flights of westerners a week you would think it was worth their while to open it) and nothing at all airside aside from a few plastic chairs. Land side there is a coffee shop selling bizzarely coloured cakes and a variety of beverages but as the Turkish Airlines flight is horribly early in the morning I did not feel up to consuming anything so cannot comment!
"Airport is ok, good transport links to cities. Minus marks for the pre-flight 'security' screening Area C - the queues are poorly managed, large volume of passengers are funneled into an area not designed for the traffic, leave plenty of time to get through this ordeal. The hall is not air conditioned (25c+), the queues are not orderly adding to an already stressful situation. Düsseldorf Airport uses Naked Scanners. I found this demeaning, there were children, elderly and the rest of us all subject to this unnecessary procedure. While the staff were polite and generally efficient."
As I have family in the region I have used the airport at least 30 times within the last 20 years. Comparing to Frankfurt this airport does not cut it for me. Coming in by train with heavy luggage many times the moving staircase at the station did not work which in course caused 50 or more people waiting to use the only elevator available to get to the sky train station finally bringing you to the actual airport. No baggage carts available at the station nor other than in Frankfurt check in facilities right at the station. 5 or 6 times the sky train did not work and substitute transport by bus was arranged. Again a real hassle if you travel with heavy luggage. First spot to find a luggage cart is only to be found after the moving staircase down at the actual airport and that only if you walk out of the airport and pay 2 euros. Hence while also in FRA you have to pay for luggage carts it does not reflect any international standard. One repeating deficiency is the security personnel (not Federal Police but private contractors) after immigration. While immigration is very professional fast and friendly the security staff are while obviously effective very unfriendly in their with no doubts not easy job. I do not expect any entertainment or similar while passing security but the words please and thank you are considered basic respect and education. I have to point out that I have never been directly offended or treated unfair by any means but it very much looks like the contracted security company does not even require a basic education for their staff and hires out of the long unemployment lines just about anyone with a clean police record regardless of ability to deal with the public and/or paying passengers.
Dusseldorf is a nice airport that is in a convenient location from where I was staying in Dusseldorf. I flew from New York to Dusseldorf and was greeted by a very cheery customs agent. I was one of the only people on my flight who was not a citizen of the European Union so the agent seemed happy to have someone to talk to. The terminal area was nice and spacious. They had duty free shops that sold everything and some small cafes. The gate areas were small though especially for the international flights. This airport had a lot of signs to direct everyone. Some of the staff got annoyed when they had to speak in English instead of German though.
"I recently flew from Dublin to Dusseldorf and was very upset with the rudeness of the security staff in the airport. The beeper went when I walked through so I needed to have my shoes (which I had been told not to remove) and feet checked etc. This was no problem whatsoever with me except that the security guard refused to speak one word of English so I had no idea what she meant. However the language barrier was not the problem. She was abrupt and rude throughout the whole procedure. When she had finished checking my shoes and feet she stood up folded her arms and stared away in the distance. Wary of leaving without ""permission"" I stood up and asked clearly ""Is it ok to go?"" (unfortunately I don't speak German but this has never been a problem before). In reply the security guard turned her head away and completely ignored me! I have taken approximately 10 flights a year for the past five years and I have never experienced such rudeness. I cannot find any facility for customer complaint on the Dusseldorf Airport website."
30 January. First time I've taken an outbound flight from D'dorf although I've arrived here in the past. Fortunately we arrived with over two hours to spare because it took forever to get through security. No good reason other than the staff were very slow and prioritised chatting with each other to processing passengers. We were there the day after they'd been on strike (pay dispute) and it certainly looked like they were still on go- slow. Apart from that you're forced to walk through shops to get to the gates but that's the case at many airports these days. It felt crowded with inadequate seating but we were there at peak time (Friday evening). What was worrying was that our plane was delayed because passengers (who had arrived at the airport in good time) were stuck in the security queue - there was no system for pulling people out and prioritising them if their flight was due to leave. D'Dorf seriously needs to sort this out. I probably will fly from this airport again because it's about the only German airport I can fly to Leeds Bradford from but I won't look forward to the experience and if there's an alternative I'll take it.
"If you take the train it counts as a local ticket however to my understanding when you get to the ""station' you have to buy a new ticket to take the sky train to the actual terminals. Know your terminal before you get on (just look at the departure boards in the skytrain area). Staff were the usual German indifferent place was clean and I didn't find it crowded. Took about 5 min to get through security and everything was on time."
Airport is ok security is a travesty terminal B lanes only 1 gate open at noon 120 min line up to get through. 35 minutes. If I had a shop behind security I would go crazy with the customers being put on hold before the gates outright stupid in every conceivable way.
The airport wasn't even busy and it seemed like the staff had their thoughts elsewhere. Staff can barely even exchange basic courtesies even in German.
My Homebase airport and of course I'd like to start and to arrive here. But I also want to criticize some points: no free Wlan! I think this is really utterly impossible in the modern world of today! Other thing is when I see the passport control for non-EU citizens its always crowded specially when the noon times airliners from UAE Russia and Turkey (with 777 and A330) arrive. Parking is too expensive! Bus connections could be better. Remaining points are ok. The airport is very clean they solved the problems with the signs and also the gastronomy is very good (but also very expensive!). Personnel are mostly very friendly and there are not many delays on a normal day.
Started and arrived from here a lot of times yet. Very good airport with good signage a lot of restaurants and shops and the ways to the gates are not long. You can easily access it by car public transport or taxi. A visitors terrace is available.
I used this airport as I had flight connection. I had to stay there for 3 hours. Airport looks very nice and have lots of shops to visit. Unfortunately there is no free wifi (not even in coffee shops or restaurants) There is an option to use service of one of well known mobile network provider but it's very expensive £4 for 30 mins. Direction signs are clear toilets everywhere. Very close to city centre. Seats in waiting areas are comfortable.
The airport is overall fine. Nothing extraordinary nothing really bad. It's very grey and lacks nice stores and restaurants. I was connecting flights here with Lufthansa and missed my flight therefore my waiting time for the next flight was 5 hours. Unfortunately the whole terminal was very cold it almost felt like the heating was not working hence the very low score. Waiting for 5 hours in a cold terminal building is not fun plus the internet access is not free. I paid 12 euros for 4 hours. Also there are not enough electricity outlets especially next to seats and I observed many people trying to find one.
Connected twice here. Didn't find it too hard to get around. Staff very friendly. In the off duty area you might as well have thought you were in a small shopping park. the gate was OK. A few rows of chairs for a regional flight it was good. Security was quick and easy.
The worst airport you could travel from. Very disrespectful staff from all departments and areas. Inconvenient facilities. Outdated design and very limited duty free options. Try to avoid using this airport as much as possible.
Dusseldorf is a big little airport. Its clean simple and easy to navigate. We only had one issue the pre- departure passport check was extremely understaffed so we were almost late for are flight. Besides that everything was okay.
Non EU immigration took over 3 hours to reach one of the 2 windows open over 400 crushing chaotically in a small area with no queue system. Very disorganized and poorly resourced - but a couldn't-care-less attitude prevails. A very unpleasant place to pass through.
I arrived at Dusseldorf International from New York very early in the evening. Immigrations was very fast the fastest I've experienced. When we got to baggage claim area the baggage was already on the carrousel. No problem at customs so 40 minutes after arrival we were buying our S-Bahn (train) tickets to go to downtown Dusseldorf which is 15-20 minutes away. The airport is modern and very clean. There's plenty of places to eat and buy - there is a supermarket inside the terminal. The only thing that didn't work for us was that the train ticket machines didn't accept our US-Bank debit cards so we had to get cash in order to pay the tickets but there was no Deutsche Bank ATM in the airport and we had to get cash from another ATM which had no agreement with our US Bank resulting in higher fees. However I think that this is an excellent airport. Our outbound flight was from Berlin.
Airport is modern and clean well connected by road and public transport but the security check is a disaster. The staff are slow arrogant and unhelpful. Queuing took forever even fast track. Beware you get charged 1€ if you require a plastic bag for liquids. I never carry any but I thought that was shocking given that airport charges are included in tickets.
The airport itself is very convenient however the car parking situation is very bad. In May there was no long term parking place left although plenty of space you had to reserve a place through the Internet before leaving which we didn't. The second time in July I tried to reserve a place some days before we left but now all long term parking places were already occupied. Next time we will try to avoid using Dusseldorf airport.
No waiting at check-in (Air Berlin/Niki) nor security. Boarding was little chaotic but OK. Only downside was that we waited for baggage pretty long time. Airport also seemed to me as easy to transfer. Overall very good experience in modern terminal.
Dusseldorf is a modern clean and relatively efficient airport. I found it for the most part user-friendly in terms of the facilities and lack of queues. Just one minor complaint though the signage is really poor sending you in circles and to dead-ends. There are two floors for departures which can be confusing and you really have to keep your eyes peeled to keep track of where you're heading.
Excellent airport. Good for changing flights too. Well laid-out. Good shopping and food outlets. Friendly staff clean and well connected by trains and road. Good choice of destinations and flights.
I used Dusseldorf airport for the first time to try and fly back to Ireland for Christmas via Aer Lingus. After a 3-hour journey through snow and ice-covered Dutch/German motorways I arrived at 9am. with 1.5 hours to spare and managed to find a space in a long-term carpark. I found the airport lively and efficient. Because of the inclement weather flights were being cancelled with frequent regularity and I didn't hold out much hope for mine. However the runways opened at midday and Aer Lingus passengers were called to Gate C. By 2pm there was still no gate number allocated to my flight and then it was suddenly cancelled. What followed was farcical. Nobody could help with any practical advice
Excellent airport with great facilities short distances and almost no queues. Clean restrooms some good food-outlets and acceptable prices in shops. Nothing to complain about.
Used it a few times as it is closer to my home as Amsterdam. Furthermore the waiting lines are so short. Airport is fresh and clean and luggage arrives very quickly. Staff is friendly and helpful.
Recently I had the opportunity to use DUS for the first time on a return flight to LGW. I was extremely impressed with the efficiency of this airport with the quick and easy connection from the city by public transport and upon arrival at the airport doubly impressed with the ease of getting around the terminal and by the number of places to grab a snack before the flight. The airline personnel were friendly and helpful as were the German security and Immigration staff which I found rather unusual since more often than not I find these officals in Germany to be a bit to informal. Perhaps it was because they were all going on their break or maybe they had just returned - whatever I was impressed.
It has easy access to the train station autobahn etc. The staff is friendly and helpful. The facilities are clean security organized and efficient.
Modern and clean airport with short ways upon arrival. If you head for downtown Dusseldorf I would recommend the suburb train line 11 (S-Bahn 11). The railway station is located one floor underneath the arrivals hall whereas the long-distance station can only be reached via the skytrain. Travel time to the city centre around 15 mins and the ticket machines are easy to use.
Extremely clean and polite ground crew to help however by 9pm all of the shops in the airport had closed and there was nowhere to buy any food or drink in the departure lounge which made for a very long night. No entertainment nor wireless internet available unless you are a Vodafone customer.
Living close to the German border this is the closest airport. Easy to reach easy to navigate and no long walks and plane-taxiing. Security staff ranges from rude to friendly. Buy delicious sandwiches at 'Kamps' in the arrival area. Much cheaper than elswhere. 'Geheimtipp': the parking at the railwaystation costs only 7 euros/24 h. So for a short trip it's much cheaper. Follow signs 'Fernbahnhof' and take the skytrain from the station to the terminal.
Good efficient and clean airport of medium size. Good facilities. Normal customs and security. Cheaper long term parking is available just outside the terminal area. However beware that passenger and luggage drop-off at the terminal building is NOT possible. You MUST park in one of the terminal parking (at a stiff hourly rate) and then find your way to a luggage cart and the terminal building.
I agree with the previous comments on the security. They are terribly serious about the size and the content of your hand-carry items. My bag travelled with me through many airports but only in DUS was it stopped because it's too big (?? in DUS but not in airports in UK US Asia France etc. It's just a normal schoolbag but they say they only permit item of size like a laptop bag.) And they even ask to weigh my hand-carry bag though it doesn't look heavy at all.
DUS airport is one of the most efficient and clean airports I used. Hardly any queues good public transport connections friendly staff and a modern building. The main reason I use the airport is because of the good connections with cheap operators. Downsides are expensive parking (EUR 90 a week) and unclear signs.
Liked Dusseldorf. Though Schiphol is around 40 kms away we took the 200 km drive to Dusseldorf. Both fares and taxes/charges are considerably lower at Dusseldorf. The two of us saved about €900 compared to the cheapest option from Schiphol. We liked DUS easy to navigate quick check-in got our bags fast and were out of the airport in 15 minutes. Will be back.
Living in Nijmegen about halfway in between Düsseldorf and Amsterdam I make sure I depart from here whenever flying on a proper airline. Düsseldorf is a breeze compared to it's bigger sibling 200 kms northwest. Airside facilities are a wee bit sparse but in return it's quiet efficient fast and has friendly staff that knows what they're there for. In my opinion those are the things that make an airport deserve a high star rating. No machine-gun toting military police present like in AMS and on the way back from Miami last year I went from jetway to S-bahn in nine minutes on a flight coming from ATL. Try that in AMS you'll still be waiting in security by the time I'm drinking a cold one at home.
Calm efficient terminal with accomodating staff. However the renovation zones were an eyesore and there was one seat for every 6 people. Lines were long and nobody could find a bathroom unless it was a handicap bathroom with a long line. Didn't like the fact that I had to walk down 3 stories from the door to the bus then have a ten minute bus ride to the plane. Couldn't find a store with affordable food. Still much better than Frankfurt.
Good airport that does it's utmost to service it's customers. I've been there from way before the fire and after the fire when they had beerhall tents to handle passengers and luggage. They have been less fanatical in introducing more airport security after 9-11. The hotels at the airport are reasonable and clean. The only problems are their waiting area for cars picking up passengers which is too small. The train connection looks great but services could be more frequent. And finally people should not mix up lousy Dusseldorf regional in Weeze with the quality that Dusseldorf International has to offer.
I can only agree with the 2 previous comment. I arrived at security with my liquids in a non Dusseldorf airport standard plastic bag. I was told to buy one from the machine for €1. I did not have a euro but was allowed to take one item though without a bag but lost the other two items. Beware Dusseldorf standard plastic bags are mandatory though it appears they do not use the proceeds of selling them to the benefit of the airport in general. Also I have never come across this at any other airport in Europe.
Previous commentators are correct about the attitude of the security staff at DUS. I had a pot of jam confiscated as it was over 100ml despite this not being a problem at security in Hamburg two hours earlier. Airside facilities in the non-alliance pier were spartan and the entire place looked as if it had not been uprgraded since the early 70s. The Lufthansa pier is slightly nicer.
Drop off area: Can't believe they charge £1 to enter the drop off zone. That's worse than charging £1 for a small plastic bag to go thru customs or £2 for a bottle of water when in the departure lounge. How desperate are these airports to extract cash from hard working people.
"Completely rammed and manic at 6.30am on a Monday morning - took about 3/4 hour to get through security. Grubby little duty free zone which everyone is then forced through before reaching inadequate seating areas. At least the café section upstairs is now finished. When returning on Monday afternoon forced onto two busses even though we were 20 yards from the Terminal, and took nearly 1 hour to get through passport control, and baggage claim. It is a good job that this formerly lovely little local airport is just 8 minutes from our home or I would not use it."
"We arrived on 22 June at 23.40. We had to wait on the plane for 35 minutes as there were no steps available to let us off the plane and no buses to take us to the terminal. They are getting too big and cannot cope with the passenger numbers. It had been a long day, we just wanted home, not stuck on a runway. Will try Doncaster airport next time."
"Never had any problems with this airport. Even first thing in the morning at its busiest, check-in was quick and was straight through security. We went from the car park to the departure lounge in barely more than 10 minutes! Although the duty free, shopping and restaurant/bar areas have improved, there's not a huge choice yet still adequate for an airport of this size. The departure lounge itself is fairly basic but serves its purpose. Passport Control as usual only took a few minutes and prompt baggage reclaim on arrival. In terms of getting to/from the airport, excellent links by road but the nearest rail station is a bit of a distance. The key thing for any regional airport is to be quick and convenient and East Midlands does that to perfection."
On returning from France on Easter Monday there was only one Long stay car park bus operating. It was overcrowded to the point of being illegal according to the allowed numbers printed inside the bus itself. It had to leave many people behind at the terminal and then drop off at all the long stay car parks making for a lengthy wait. On arrival at long stay 4 already delayed no cars were being allowed out of the exit without a telephone call to control and having to state your registration number a complete shambles. The bus and car park delay saw me exit the airport over an hour and 30 mins after the plane had landed and only with cabin baggage. Not a great experience.
"Our outbound experience was quite good. Check in took 5 minutes and security was cleared in a similar time. Our return experience was very different. It was pouring with rain when we landed. We had to leave the plane on steps and get on a waiting bus. We were then dropped some distance from the terminal building and left to walk in the rain. The queue for the electronic passport clearance stretched across the entry door making it difficult for people to get in. By the time we did we were soaked along with a couple of hundred other people. I considered asking my wife to wait with the luggage while I ran to the car in long stay 2 but I could not see any obvious place for her to wait so already being very wet we just walked. There is no transport to this car park. When we were ready to leave the car park it took a while to find my way out. There are no ""exit"" arrows and the only ""exit"" sign is actually right next to the exit. It is not high enough to be seen by someone sitting in a car. This happened in daylight. In the dark a person would be left completely at a loss. I will avoid East Midlands from now on."
"I have used EMA once before arriving by car when the airport was satisfactory. However this time I travelled to/from the airport using public transport - train to Long Eaton and bus a route that is suggested by the airport itself as follows ""The Skylink bus connects this station with the airport up to every 20 minutes seven days a week with a journey time of 20 minutes"". This is incorrect and if your flights depart or arrive in the rush hour or out of normal hours I strongly suggest not using this routing. The timing is very erratic and the bus from Long Eaton A) does not stop at Long Eaton station itself instead at bus stops several hundred yards up or down the high street and B) seems to also stop at all normal bus stops between the station and the airport. This means that the ""20 minute"" journey time is unreliable - also the busses do not go ""up to every 20 minutes"". I travelled with just hand luggage and on the way home landed at EMA 85 minutes before my train was due to depart from Long Eaton - plenty of time. Immigration was quick enough but then I waited much more than 20 minutes for a bus and the ""20 minute"" journey to Long Eaton took about 40 mins. Result: missed train. Long Eaton was also unmanned (despite it being peak hours) and with a dead mobile phone it was tricky to work out alternative travel arrangements. I therefore strongly suggest using Derby or Nottingham instead of Long Eaton and also leaving much more time than you expect for the journey on the Skylink bus - especially if near peak rush hour times."
Overall EMA is an OK provincial airport with good parking and average shops and F&B facilities. It is spoilt by the horrendous experience of queuing to get through outbound security and inbound immigration. You are treated like cattle in both areas being made to wait and wait and wait by staff who don' t care less.
I travel quite frequently for holidays and have always championed East mids they were one of the first to re- introduce a smoking area airside well done! Then with the improvements that's where the pleasure flying from here ends! Queuing horrendous in security only to then have a long walk through duty free like a maze to get to the smaller shops to buy water queuing again for ages and trying to find somewhere to sit downstairs is a nightmare then off to have a cigarette which in fairness the smoking area is still there! But to get to it you have to fight your way through hoards of people queuing at the gates tripping over people's hand luggage trolleys they have replaced the big pub area at the back with a brand new executive lounge which takes up most of the downstairs area for which you have to pay to use fair enough! But then you want the toilet again fight your way back to get to these seems to me East mids is a victim of their own success. With the vast improvements being made the airport as got to busy and spoilt flying from this airport it's such a shame.
"I live 10 minutes from EMA and would only use it for that reason. Today we were made to walk from the aircraft to the immigration in the pouring rain no buses (they seem to have done away with them) and not even a covered walkway. The poor folks at the back of the (long) immigration queue were stood outside! We were soaked but at least inside. None of the passport scanners were working why bother with them? It seems the building work is going on forever. It should be demolished and rebuilt to make it a decent facility because as it stands it is not fit for purpose. The charge for ""drop off"" just smacks of desperation the drop is so rammed with cars and people it doesn't work anyway. Unfortunately I doubt if any of the rebuilding will make any difference. We shall see."
Maybe all the people posting reviews about security staff at EMA should just stop think and take stock of why staff might get a little disgruntled and why queues can be so long. If passengers arrived consistently early as advised followed the instructions about liquids emptied their pockets properly and basically followed the rules (all of which are well publicised) then the process would be much simpler and easier for all. And next time you are waiting in the queue just think its all for your safety. Outbound security is there to identify possible threats to the airport and your flight. Would you rather they skipped through things. If they are taking time to scrutinise an x-ray then its because there is something they are not sure about. I have travelled through EMA and other airports and EMA are very good and friendly. No problems if you treat the staff with the same respect you would expect from them.
Having read a lot of the previous reviews my expectations of EMA were quite low I need not have worried though. Return flight from Belfast was a breeze landed ahead of schedule and was straight through customs with no queues similar experience the other way. Very clean and tidy well sign posted and catering facilities were impressive the Skyline bus to Derby was only Â£8 return Bristol Airport take note! Oddly enough this airport looks pretty grim from the outside but the inside is perfectly fine will use again in the future.
We were unfortunate enough to pass through East Midlands airport in September 2014. We arrived at the airport at around 5.40am to find queues virtually out of the terminal. We quickly realised people were queuing to scan their boarding passes. It took us a good 20 mins to get to the point of scanning ours. They wouldn't scan there was one member of staff stood at the express lane (why should people pay for the process to be efficient anyway) he really didn't want to help. He eventually let us through the gate for us to be herded into the customs lane. We really felt like cattle being herded. All the customs queues merged so people were pushing in it was horrible and absolute chaos. It took us another at least 15 mins to get through this queue. We then had to beg another member of staff to let us through express or we wouldn't have made our flight. We were then told that we had to take our hairdryer and straighteners out of our hand luggage and that our liquids bag wasn't good enough. It's was farcical and very upsetting. We managed to run for our plane and get there just on time. Whoever is in charge of running this airport should be ashamed and get some lessons in customer service. I will never travel from this airport again even if it means costing me more. Sort it out east mids and train your staff to be more helpful!
"Never used EMA before and approached with an open mind. First impressions not great - automated number plate recognition for per booked parking not working (no signs) and long stay car park a long way from terminal with no bus service and very poor surfaces making it tricky to push trolley. At one point during trek to Departures our cases fell from the trolley leaving my wife and kids temporally stranded on the zebra crossing - not really EMA's fault but was amazed as an airport Security car drove straight across crossing (steering around my young children) before we could recover. From this point things didn't get any better. Expensive food in departure lounge - served cold used chewing gum stuck to barriers dirty toilets. Could things get any worse for our return? Yes! We arrived back in the UK at around midnight to be confronted with a queue that extended some distance from the Security/immigration building. Here we stood with two freezing children for an hour and a half - much of the time without cover as it started to drizzle. No explanation or apology provided other than a rude and condescending response that ""Immigration are not quick enough"" when somebody within the queue had the audacity to ask why we were being asked to stand outside. Upon our eventual arrival to the baggage area our flight had been removed from the displays making it difficult to identify the correct conveyor belt. Upon locating bags (fortunately not ours) had fallen from the conveyor belt and were left to roll across airport floor. I've never even considered reviewing an airport before. As a relatively frequent traveller I've learned to accept the inevitable Security scrutiny and without exception (until now) found airport around the world to be operated efficiently and courteously. But the was not my experience with EMA and unless unavoidable I won't be returning."
If you knew when the peak hours were and could avoid them I'm sure that as some reviewers have said this airport would be nice and easy to 'walk through'. Between 4.45am and 7am in the morning however it is an absolute nightmare. Drop off point ridiculously congested checking in area a mess. Despite managing to check in with Ryanair well before the desks closed going through security was horrendous. Queued for an hour and a half to get through to security just in time to be denied entrance to the airplane along with about 20 others. There then followed another hour and a half in a queue at the service desk just to get transfers. Well done East Midlands and the security measures. Whilst I can appreciate we don't want any security issues the lack of information or assistance only added to the stress. I hope you enjoy your refit as we for one don't ever want to visit again. Life is too short. As the 'Recommend' button only has the option of Yes or No not 'Are you kidding?' then I will just have to put 'No'.
After reading the reviews on the internet whilst stuck in traffic I was panicking that we would get our flight. We eventually arrived at the airport parked in jet parks and the whole airport experience was great we sailed through check in no queues in security and staff were pleasant the airport seems to be having some work done at the moment but we managed to eat get magazines and the flight even left early I had no problems once we got to the airport.
The facilities here for collecting friends or colleagues upon arrival are a nightmare. You have a choice upon arrival of short stay or 10 minutes drop off. Threatening notices about £100 fines if you outstay your 10 minutes and no facility to pay with notes. You do have a choice of paying by card with a 150% surcharge of £1.50. I thought merchant costs were meant to be about 4% tops.
Truly the worst UK airport horrendous queues rude staff complete lack of customer service - how to ruin your business trip or holiday - 100s of people made to stand in a queue for an hour without being able to go to the toilet and rude staff claiming we are understaffed there is no one to deal with it! I dread using It and it is always as bad if not worse than the previous visit about time something was done about the check in and 50 minute queue for security. Sort it out East Midlands.
As we live only 10 minutes away East Midlands Airport has always been our first choice for short haul flights. However it is getting beyond a joke and our experience flying to and from Berlin last weekend has made me reluctant to use East Midlands in the future. The queues at check-in (albeit Ryanair) at 5.30 on Friday morning were huge the staff were rude and did not give any explanation of what the delay was about. Once though into departures there were no seats available and all retail outlets were very overcrowded - it was a 15 minute wait to get a cup of coffee. On our return late on Monday evening we had to queue for over 40 minutes to get through passport control and the bags were on a completely different carousel from that indicated on the TV screens. Finally we were told that the wait for our pre-booked taxi would be 30 minutes. Happily after I went into meltdown mode Arrow Cars managed to get us a cab within 15 minutes. The airport clearly cannot cope with the number of flights that is has contracted for and needs to take some action without delay or there will be a mass move to Birmingham.
Monday 2 June 6.30am - flying to Corfu. What has happened to the nice local airport that used to be East Midlands? The last time I flew from E. Midlands (admittedly some 10-15 years ago) it was a joy to use. Sadly not anymore. Absolutely heaving at 6.30am on a Monday morning with droves of passengers being herded through a cramped and crummy duty free area immediately after security into the pathetically inadequate seating areas. And upon return on 9th June the plane stopped some 30 yards from the terminal - so of course we all had to get on busses to be taken to the actual building. Really? I am aware that you have to keep outbound and inbound passengers apart but this is ridiculous. And as for passport control - somebody needs to improve the electronic passport gates or do away with them. This airport is no longer a joy to use - its only saving grace is that it is minutes from my home or I would not use it.
Horrendous experience with security yesterday. Massive queues people couldn't get through the automatic gates while the staff told passengers to move through the same blocked gates. Round the corner to find more queues and a security guard staring for 5+ minutes or more at the x-ray contents of 1 bag. I started to worry about just what he had found that was so dangerous it couldn't even be taken out of the machine to be manually checked. I thought that was what the system was all about. Meanwhile an elderly man was being subjected to a remarkably intimate search in front of a fascinated crowd. And then there's the confused signage impossible parking and general chaos at the Ryanair gates. I've been a regular user over the past 9 months but I really can't stick it any longer. Birmingham is better. Never thought I'd say that. EMA is best avoided unless you really have no alternative.
Me and my wife used the airport last week to fly to Ibiza. We found the security staff to be actually very friendly and a lot more helpful than staff at other near by airports I walked through and sounded the alarm on the metal detector and had to take my shoes off which I didn't mind because the staff asked nicely. I think half of the problem with the attitude report by some people about the security guards is that people probably go with the attitude to cause a problem. The departure lounge was good and the flight left on time.
"We travelled from East Midlands to Murcia on Ryanair FR1924 departing 16.55 on Friday 11th April. We knew that traffic could be bad on Friday afternoons so booked the security express lane at a cost of £6 for the two of us. On arrival at 15.45 we had to join a queue in a temporary tunnel - which moved very slowly. When we reached the boarding pass desk situated below a sign saying ""Express Lane"" that was blocked. Staff member said they only have one lane. We joined the lengthy queue and eventually got to the gate at 16.32 (gate closure was 16.35). We watched another teenager who had inadvertently left something in a pocket that triggered the scanner alarm be treated with a similar attitude but with added obvious annoyance and eye rolling. My wife has had a similar attitude from security staff over the size of the liquids bag which she had carried on 3 other flights to and from USA. This is completely unacceptable but passengers have little time to complain there and then. Other passengers in the queue noted this indifferent hostile behaviour and said that it was typical for this airport. The express lane was sold to me a few days before the flight but we almost missed our flight because it didn't operate and security was so slow and inefficient. Surely the express lane is needed when alterations are being carried out causing extra delays? I realise that the express lane is no guarantee of getting through faster but it does reduce the stress of getting to the gate on time until the point when it is withdrawn and the staff at the airport have no idea what to do. We're flying from Birmingham in August and would not recommend East Midlands to anyone unless there is no alternative."
Landed at East Midlands on 15 March at about 6.45. Yet again ridiculous queues for passport control why are the electronic gates never open here? Had misfortune to visit the ladies toilets in the baggage claim hall they were absolutely filthy with several blocked! They certainly hadn't been inspected that day never mind in the last hour! it's about time things were improved here. Car park also a joke.
I hope that this airport is going to be reconstructed soon? In the meantime if you suffer from claustrophobia give this airport a miss (if you can)? The queues for the gates cut through the bars and cafes of the departure lounge and the space between yourself and the obligatory seats is devoid of space. There are no piers so walking out onto the tarmac in all weathers is a chance you certainly have to take. Arrivals is chaotic where the number of automatic immigration scanners don't match the number of people with the new biometric passport so fast track doesn't exist. It was quicker to go via the immigration official. It would certainly appear that demand on this airport has certainly been outweighed by its size and content. A definite upgrade is deserved here sooner rather than later.
As frequent users of EMA over 25 years we have gradually decided that standards have really gone down and we now quite dread using it. Last week the place was so full and congested at 5am security staff rude offhand wearing their jobsworth hats. When told to remove my flat shoes with a metal buckle I said I didn't want to walk on the dirty floor and was told I had to it wasn't her job to help me. She turned her back and resumed her chatting to 2 other staff. Queues for bottles of water at boots snaked all round the shop. No newspapers in smiths. Expensive food. Hard to find a seat. Staff seemed to enjoy social chats rather than helping customers. Regrettably we are booked to fly again twice more this year. Then next time BA from LHR! Our relations who we're travelling with us last week normally use Birmingham and said this was the last EMA for them. On arrival the wait for steps then the crammed busses and the wet walk into arrivals were poor as usual. Why can't they invest in piers and become a proper modern airport? We paid a lot for a special celebration cruise which was lovely but Spoilt by EMA at start and finish.
"I live within 30 minutes of EMA and it always used to be my ""first choice"" airport but not anymore! The drop off and pick up facilities are a joke and parking facilities in general are a disgrace short stay is frequently rammed and it's still a fair walk to a the terminals through what is basically a building site! ££7 to park for 65 minutes (would have got it in the hour if the pay station machine wasn't broken and then the ""card only"" machines have the cheek to charge you an extra Â£1.50 to use a card). Medium stay parking is expensive long stay parking is miles away with a bus service. Security queues are horrendous staff were rude and arrogant and you are left with hundreds of stressed customers. The ""food and beverage"" offering defies belief shocking quality and rip-off prices. I now do everything possible to avoid flying from here despite it virtually being on my doorstep and that's a sad statement. For Europe trips now I try and use the train or for farther afield I travel the few extra miles and fly from Birmingham."
This airport is a disgrace. This year it is celebrating 50 years of business. Some of the old same buildings are still in use. East Midlands airport is the gateway to the whole region millions of people live close by and it is the first and last impression that visitors from all over the world get of the area. It is dirty over crowded and cluttered. Airport owners wake up we need a new showcase terminal. You have taken our money for years and given nothing back. Like many other people I have no choice but to fly into East Midlands airport. Please give us an airport we can be proud of. The 12 million pounds you are spending is peanuts as you know. All you ever seem to do is mend and make do.
"The experience at Edinburgh Airport was by far the worst I've had. I arrived almost three hours before departure. First I had to wait for check-in for 1.5 hours. Then, without proper information, I was put in a queue to security that took another 40 minutes. At security I was met with angry and irritated personnel. I almost missed my plane due to this chaotic treatment."
First time from Edinburgh to Singapore. Business class but no fast track. Poor system with rude and unhelpful staff.  Returned on a cold and windy day disembarked through to immigration and baggage reclaim. You have to come through immigration then go outside again. Inadequate toilet facilities. It's unwelcoming and no advert for Scotland. The drop off and pick up area poorly sign posted. Very poor customer service and basic information.
"Had been expecting problems after reading the reviews about check-in, and security, but found the process to be very smooth and fast. Good choice of food inside and airport (including the toilets) was clean."
"Very impressed with the 'low cost carrier' bag drop where you tag your own bag. Very fast throughput, with helpful staff both at the ticket machines and the counter drop area. Would be happy to see this being used elsewhere! The security system was faster and more efficient than I've seen elsewhere, at least four people could offload their hand baggage at once and then once through the security control, move it over to an area where they could 'reassemble' their bags/electrical items/belts/shoes/liquids etc without hindering others waiting for their baggage to clear the scan. A most positive experience. Waiting/shopping/eating area airside has plenty of natural air, space and seats. Far more pleasant than I had anticipated."
"Standard slipped in the space of 3 months. Huge queues for security even using the fastTrack facility, lazy ground staff with no sense of urgency. Often waiting at a gate or stand for 10 minutes for the ground staff to arrive. Quote a pilot ""Well we've found our correct stand but looks like no one else has"". Finally the traffic system to allow private hire taxis into the airport is totally flawed. Regularly wait 10/15 minute to get access into the drop off area which the charge the taxi drivers a huge premium to use! Changes need to be made!"
"Edinburgh Airport is a good airport. The arrival process on a domestic flight is as simple as can be and you are out within 10 mins of arriving. However they require more taxis as we had to wait 30 mins for a Taxi when we arrived. Departing, we didn't have bags so went straight through but the airport security was really quick for the morning rush. Shops are great there and you can also have a good view of the aircraft and the runway. Boarding began 50 mins before for the flight to Stansted and started to board within 10 mins. This meant we were airborne early and could arrive 40 mins early into London. The airport is clean and I couldn't recommend this airport anymore."
"What has happened to Edinburgh airport? We had a shambolic experience going through the security checks it is a nightmare which is stressful when going on holiday. On arriving back the delays getting you off the planes and buses due to the queuing at passport control, are out of order. This will cost the airport custom as we are regular users, we will be monitoring the situation."
The parking drop off and pick up signs are incredibly confusing. It is almost impossible to work out which signs to follow for drop off and pick up. And why charge for it? Many airports give you 15 minutes free in short stay. The fee is very offputting for people.
What has happened to Edinburgh Airport check in procedure? Not just one queue but 3 queues to check in? People in a bad mood before going on holiday. Horrible experience. Even the staff seemed confused at the level of pandemonium. Who's idea was this fiasco? I have always loved this airport as it has alwasy been a seemless process but will never fly from Edinburgh again. We never had time to try any of the facilities as it took us over an hour to get through passport control!
"Experience of this airport was shambolic to say least, when entering the terminal you are met by queues with no apparent direction from the staff, at this point you think it will get better, but then when you get to security it gets even worse. Staff are unhelpful and abrupt, seeming to forget why they are there, the security scanning is chaotic, with security staff holding up bags asking who belongs to this bag, if the airport wants to expand it will have to get it's act together. On the return we landed slightly early but could not get slot to disembark so had to wait 20 minutes with another 4 planes behind us, when we got to baggage conveyor there was baggage from 2 flights on at same time. I have travelled from Edinburgh before but after this experience I doubt I would use it again"
"An entirely unpleasant experience all round arriving from London City. Our taxi time on landing took a very long time, which was then compounded by boarding a bus and make a long and crammed journey to the terminal. Had hoped to make up for lost time by grabbing a taxi, but the queue meant the bus was a better option. On departure, whilst the security was not exactly top class prior to the changes made over the past year, it has now become comfortably the worst I've experienced in the past ten years. Only two lanes were open despite a long queue. Those lanes which were open were a complete shambles - the system simply doesn't seem to work. To make a bad situation worse, as others have commented, the staff are extremely abrupt (possibly they are frustrated with the shortcomings of the system they work with, but who really cares?) to the point of being rude. They leave a sour taste and leave an awful final impression of the city/country. I had intended to make a purchase and perhaps buy a sandwich, but the time spent going through security put paid to that. The train or flying into Glasgow certainly seem more attractive options in the future."
"I can only say that going through security is shambolic, short staffing does not help. Not happy at being put through this stress whilst at the start of a holiday. Thank goodness for the Aspire Lounge."
"The incompetence of the security system and rude staff are well-documented. The upshot of this shambles is that no passengers have any time to relax with a drink or time to do shopping before going to their gate: they are all too late by then. Hence, the outlets and cafes in the departure section will be losing money because of the ineptitude of the airport to whom they are paying fees. Arrival was equally bad: the plane sat for 10 minutes awaiting clearance to move to the arrival ramp, then a further 10 minutes for steps to arrive. We stepped out to be met by two buses, both of which then waited another 10 minutes for all passengers to exit the aircraft and embark. Expansion of the number of the flights to and from the airport in order to increase profits has been undertaken with insufficient expenditure or planning within the terminal. "
"The security queues in particular were shambolic, staff rude and uncaring. The dining facilities at this airport leave a lot to be desired. Be prepared passengers, this will be a nightmare."
"I got a shock in February when I used the new security system for the first time. Even though queues weren't worse than the previous system I was bewildered by how different the staff were. They didn't seem to know what was going on, either complaining to each other or rude towards passengers. I have used the airport twice since then and been very lucky as there has not been a queue. The system that pulls luggage out for double check seems rather sensitive, I have never had a bag double checked before and it has happened two out of the 3 times I've used new security. Last time there was a backlog of 6-8 trays to be double checked and one member of staff. For me this is what causes a lot of the confusion - it is not clear what you are to do once you go there. The first time I moved from it to put my stuff on the belt and was told to wait, second time I waited and was told to go ahead. The third time I went ahead but couldn't get my trays fitted in together. Which as previous reviews have stated means your stuff is often at the other end before you are, unattended. It is worth remembering that it wasn't exactly a breeze at the old security, it could take at least half an hour at busy times.  I have still given a 6/10 review as despite finding staff quite rude and the system shambolic I have obviously been lucky with queues. I will continue to use the airport for convenience but almost feel embarrassed for Edinburgh that people have such bad experiences."
Terribly slow again through security.  An Edinburgh Airport spokesman declared that the problem arises when a lot of passengers arrive at the same time. With such logic and grasp of the situation is it any wonder that the security system is inefficient and that nothing appears to be in hand to correct matters.
"I regularly travelled through Edinburgh until recently. I found an alternative routing for work so I use other airports now, due to the absolutely shambolic security. I used to check in as soon as I arrived at the airport, or online when I could, and join the queue. I knew that 2 hrs is potentially not enough time at Turnhouse. The system is a massive upgrade from the old one, but the experience of this upgrade is  far worse than the previous system which was also poor. The staff were unfriendly and rude, and the queueing time was obscene. It does not paint a pretty picture for Scotland's premier airport. Glasgow had a similar upgrade, but, from my experience, has managed to make their security better than Edinburgh's. I'd avoid this place until there is an overhaul of security."
"Having read of delays at this departure we gave ourselves plenty of time for an early morning Saturday flight. It is chaotic. Fortunately we were hand baggage only. First choke point is the escalator to 1st floor security level followed by a walk through a restaurant before reaching security. Staff direct you to stand on numbered spots on floor. There is no signage to instruct what clothing is to be scanned - belts - shoes - watches? One of my trays was diverted for checking - because there was no image. My wife was told to take her tray over to an 'unpacking' however she was still waiting for second tray with her handbag to come through. What we seem to have is a perfect storm for delays. Rising passenger numbers, badly designed layout (forever turning corners), more passengers going 'hand baggage only' so more holdalls, cases etc to be scanned, and poor signage. We've travelled through here regularly for over 30 yrs and airport managers need to get a grip and quickly. Managers visible on the floor while this chaos continues would be a start! "
I travel to China on a regular basis on business and try to promote Scotland and encourage Chinese visitors. I am however ashamed to think that their experience on arrival and departure will be tainted by what is in my opinion is the total shambles at Edinburgh airport. Amateurish is being kind - incompetence is nearer the truth.
"Edinburgh airport has clearly invested heavily in upgrading the airport to cater for increased volumes. This has included a completely new and larger security search area. Rather than going to school on recent airport security design disasters, they have decided to maintain the trend in non user friendly local infrastructure projects and have delivered a complete abomination of a passenger security facility. The poor staff are trying their hardest to make the best of this shambles but it is a complete mess. Don't expect a modern airport experience at Edinburgh, rather ensure you give yourself plenty of time and expect to be fleeced when you use any services. Better still, use another airport or means of transport."
"New security is a total shambles and chaos from start to finish with bored, nasty and obstructive staff. I travel through Edinburgh very frequently and recommend opening up the old security area again. I travelled through the new security area the day it opened and it looked like progress. Now having gone through this area many times since it is a totally dreadful experience. Worse than an US or European major airport. Serious need to question the competence of the senior managers who allow queues of 40-50 minutes to occur. Sends a truly dreadful image of Edinburgh. Glasgow airport here I come."
"As a first time user of this airport I was extremely disappointed. Going through security was as you expect busy, however when I went through I had very rude staff who work in the duty free shop push in front of me, and were incredibly rude about it. As I walked through the scanner, I went to get my items, to which the rude employee was stood waiting for her bag. I literally just picked up my coat and she decided to be condescending and rude telling me to move my stuff. I said I'm just picking up my coat. To which she replied abruptly no one else can get their stuff - bearing in mind there was a massive queue of trays before mine, but as she pushed in those people were still filtering through. Not happy. First time users do not know how every single airport works as this one seems very different. Maybe they should come up with a better idea for staff instead of them going through with customers as they seem to not be able to get to work in enough time to allow for the checks."
"We arrived from Nice Airport to Edinburgh Airport, 8/6/2015. That in itself was a shock. We appeared to be shuffled to a shabby unused area, no thought was given to anybody with walking difficulties, lots of narrow stairs to access the shambles of passport control. No control at all. This shambles took over one hour. We eventually found our luggage, some passengers luggage was lying in a heap on the floor the rest appeared to be trapped behind the baggage area. Of course there were no staff to help."
For newly refurbished facility outwith peak season the queue just to get up to departures was huge. Once up there was a further queue to get to security. From entering the building it took 40 mins to get to security. No explanation from any staff. Embarrassed this is Scotland's prime airport.
"Until last year I have been a frequent user of Edinburgh Airport and as a citizen of Edinburgh I have felt proud of the airport as a gateway to the world. Equally I have felt proud of the way the airport has expanded and has been an example of the progress Edinburgh has been making despite the recession. Now I think the airport has been stretched beyond capacity and I think there is now a danger that people will begin to avoid the airport and once customers are lost it is very hard to persuade people to return. The problem needs to be addressed urgently otherwise the economy of Edinburgh and Scotland will ultimately suffer. Looking at the passenger reviews over the past six months or so the inadequacy of the security hall comes in for most comment. I first used the new hall on a mid-morning in April and went through relatively easily. However I went through the hall twice in late May and both times it was a bad experience. The first time was lunchtime on 21st May for a flight to Dusseldorf. It took over 30 minutes to get through and although I cleared the process with no problems I noticed that more luggage after scanning was being shunted onto another conveyer belt for further inspection than was actually being cleared. was that necessary? I also thought that staff were generally ill-mannered with quite a lot of impatient ordering with raised voices. There was a marked absence of the word please. One person who received this treatment obviously could not understand English adequately but no one seems to have taught the security person that saying something louder does not help a non-English speaker to understand. I almost interfered and then thought better of it. How easily we learn to be afraid to speak our minds in such situations. On the second occasion I had an early morning flight to Madrid. With my experience of a few days before I arrived over 2 hours before the flight and I had Fast Track through using the car park at the terminal. The terminal was in absolute pandemonium on arrival shortly before 5am. The escalators to the security hall were not working and all passengers had to make their way up the stairs carrying hand luggage. Eventually reaching the first floor I asked for Fast Track and was told rather rudely to get in the queue like everybody else. I am 66 years old but at any age one should expect to be treated with respect and politeness. i never did get to Fast Track. The crowding was unbelievable in the security hall. Once again everywhere were the raised voices of security personnel ordering people around shouting at those who were either unable to understand or were too bewildered by the experience. Many of the passengers were visitors guests to our country for heaven's sake! This time my luggage were shunted to the side and I had an interminable wait for it to be searched. While I waited to be attended to I spoke to one of the security people who was standing beside me and said that I thought the system was terrible and asked if it was always like this. She said that she was afraid it was and that it was a disaster. Eventually it was my turn to have my things inspected. The problem with my luggage was that my iPad had been stood up on its side in the tray and I was lectured by the security person. ""How can you expect your stuff to be scanned properly if you put the iPad on its side. In future remember to put it flat in the tray."" When I explained that it was one of his team who had crammed it in sideways he told me to move along and not waste his time. As well as being 66 years old and relatively healthy I have a heart condition and try to keep stress levels low. Fat chance! By the time I got through security I had to run for the gate. What bothers me most is that my experience is only one of many similar to mine Many people have been complaining of these conditions for over 6 months. Does anyone read the reviews? Certainly there is no response. Does airport management care even though it is obviously bad for the airport itself the city and the country? It is a situation that cannot go on."
Used Edinburgh Airport on 9th May 2015 for 8am flight to LHR security busy but queues never stopped moving. Through security in 10 mins without any problem.
This is the worst airport I have used and unfortunately it is my home city airport and I travel a lot. Nowhere else in UK Europe or SE Asia have I encountered such queues in security before departure interminable problems with (Menzies) poor management of getting on and off planes unnecessary use of buses when perfectly good passenger ramps are available terrible queues at passport control unhelpful and sometimes rude airport staff. Furthermore the management do not reply to emails from customers. The complex chains of corporate ownership of UK infrastructure also make those who run such facilities very unresponsive to user feedback.
"This was our first experience of Edinburgh airport and will certainly be the last! I travelled with a party of 14 girls on 25th May 15 for my daughters hen do. After being told we could only take 1 clear plastic bag with toiletries through this came as a shock as I had travelled via Gatwick airport 2 days before and had 3 plastic bags! When I queried why Gatwick do not restrict passengers to 1 clear bag he said other airports were not conforming to the rules but Edinburgh were! This was totally untrue as our friend in the next queue had 1 clear bag but had left her makeup bag in her cabin case. She asked if this needed to be removed the member of staff said ""no that's fine it will be okay""! So totally conflicting advice and obviously depends on the person you get. The outcome of delaying us for 45 mins meant no one in our group had time for food/drinks/duty free purchases or champagne planned. Not good enough Edinburgh."
"As per all the other recent reviews which were all extremely critical I can only add my total agreement. This is now the worst airport to travel through. Escalators switched off for ""health & safety"" we were told due to the amount of people trying to get to security. We were ordered into a queue so that we could join a queue in the stairs to then join yet another queue to get through to security. Unbelievable! This in total took us forty minutes. The same procedure returning from Alicante airport took exactly five minutes - we timed it. And the latest target we are told is to have one plane leaving every minute - I presume half of them will be empty to achieve this target. What this will be like in the busy summer period is anyone's guess."
Terrible experience at security check removed all the usual stuff to out in trays except couldn't get one gold bangle off as clip had stuck on showed this to the lady who was very nice but told me I had to go through body scanner which I did well here is where the bother really started  the woman who searched me said I lit up like a Xmas tree how can that be as I only had one piece of metal on? She then proceeded to search me for a whole 10 minutes after that she used the mobile machine on me and said I was fine to go. Why couldn't this over enthusiastic girl have used that first. I felt that the level of that search was unnecessary and very intrusive in front of other people. Anyway after that experience I couldn't find where my tray with my handbag cash iPad other gold jewellery phone etc was as the end of the conveyor belts are out of sight. My husband picked it up for me and no-one questioned him. So basically anyone could take your belongings. The security queues were bursting at the seams and the staff couldn't cope so why were the body searches so long. Unbelievable experience.
I am a fairly regular traveller (around twice/mth). Overall airport is very good indeed these days in all aspects except for security. A lot of money appears to have been spent on changes and now seems to be a poorer service than before especially when so-called 'Fast-track' is chosen. on the last visit (within the past week) staff were telling customers what clothing/items to put in the trays just before finally going through the screening machines i.e too late and especially confusing for the infrequent travellers - appears to be a staff training issue. Needs urgent attention before the busy holiday period.
Chaos this morning which ever clown devised this new security 'system' should be sacked absolutely unacceptable to be queuing downstairs for 25 minutes to get to the security area and even worse that 2 lines weren't working. To devise a simple staff roster including contingency for sick etc should be beyond a 10 year old. Sadly with the new owners this airport has become completely disinterested in the passengers other than to fleece them rotten. I hope with all the chaos the retailers have something to say to the management I for one will not spend a penny at the shops or bars. A disgrace to Scotland.
We were appalled by the delays in the searching of hand luggage as a result of the inefficient systems and slow and inadequate number of staff. As a consequence we almost missed our flight and were stressed by the poor customer experience. A number of women were stopped as they did not have 'appropriate' clear bags for makeup some were stopped for having more than one bag. To make matters worse the supervisor was unhelpful and truculent. We would avoid this airport in future and use Glasgow whenever we could where systems are better and staff are helpful they also have much better people skills.
Dreadful and shambolic - I arrived 2 hours ahead of my UK flight taking off. The queue at security was so long that I wasn't going to make it to the gate before it shut. This isn't an improvement it is a backward step. I would like to think that the shambles isn't a way of forcing people to pay £5 for the fast track security enabling Edinburgh Airport to make yet more money from travellers. Heaven help you if your bag does get taken to one side for further investigation you can stand and wait 45 minutes before someone looks at the bag and that assumes that you can actually find where it has come out. So your passport credit cards laptop phone etc are all sitting somewhere for anyone to just lift on the way through. The old system was infinitely better. Once I got through on the fast track I was speaking to a member of staff on the other side who said it has been dreadful and a large number of people had missed their flights due to the 'new improved' system. My advice if you have the misfortune to fly from Edinburgh is to add on at least one extra hour to when you think you should arrive that way you stand a chance of making your flight. I will fly from Glasgow in the future a much better airport.
Once again the most horrendous experience at Edinburgh airport. I have travelled through this airport at least twice a week for the last 6 years and the recent changes to security (and staff) has now made this the worst airport I have travelled through. This morning (Monday 18/5/15) they had again deliberately closed off the perfectly working escalators and lifts that would take you up to join the security queue. Customers could only access via the stairs but this morning the new rule was that a member of staff had blocked these off and was only letting customers through whose flight was within the next hour the rest had to join another queue in the check in area to be called later and this is just to get you up to the queues of the security area. The situation once up there has got worse and worse with the new tray and queuing system. As many other reviews mention some of the staff here are aggressive rude and behave absolutely inappropriately. I even saw one male security staff member deliberately hold back a customers tray (once the customer had left his belongings on the belt) so that he would be delayed further. This morning people were missing flights many were distressed older customers had to use stairs they couldn't manage I think this is an embarrassment to the fantastic city of Edinburgh and to the airport management team.
Fortunately I have arrived early for my flight today (Sunday) but I have never experienced chaos such as this. Almost impossible to enter the terminal due to the crowds of travellers who are being prevented from using escalators lifts and stairs because the departure area is too full! How can it be possible in this day and age that a key hub airport is not able to cope with it's passenger numbers. People are rightly stressed and confused particularly those for whom English is not a first language. The operator is a disgrace.
About the worst experience ever. Major wait to be dropped off then a queue way beyond the ground floor stairs to go up the stairs and then snake backwards and forwards firstly to scan boarding pass then for security. 45 minutes minimum to get through not helped by having to go through a body scan as my leather strapped wrist watch triggered a bleep. Horrible slow chaotic and insecure.
Went through security at a 'quiet' time took 35 mins. Spoke to staff and they told me that it had been testing (quote) which I take to be a polite way of saying chaotic. They are incredibly demoralised! whoever thought that 12 security gates could possibly be replaced by 6 - and be faster - must be delusional. More gates are needed and room must be found for them before Edinburgh Airport security gets an even.
"First time at EDI since the new security arrangements. I stupidly forget to remove my belt so I was put through the body scanner - fair enough nobody's fault except my own. I was travelling hand baggage only and while I was waiting to be scanned my luggage including my boarding pass medication laptop expensive camera wallet money and everything else trundled off on its own. Fortunately my wife wasn't pulled aside and after she'd recovered her own stuff she noticed a staff member looking at my tray which seemed to have reached the end of the line. The staff member asked her ""Is this yours?"" to which she replied ""No it's my husband's"" and was immediately told to take it to one of the re-packing tables. Luckily the lady who claimed to be my wife actually was my wife but she could have been anybody and I could have had my entire luggage stolen. The staff were all perfectly pleasant but the system needs an urgent re-think."
Previously a pleasure the new security system has made Edinburgh incredibly frustrating to use. Wildly inefficient system that sent the majority of the bags in my queue through to be hand checked. If you are going to hand check most of the cabin luggage you need considerably more than two people to do it.
"I realise that there is not a lot of space immediately adjacent to the terminal but it would have been nice if the powers that be had thought about passengers having to transfer from the terminal by bus to car parks and hotels. Whilst there are undercover pick up areas and indeed a large multi-storey car park connected to the terminal by a bridge those unfortunates in our group of hapless passengers walked 400 metres and stood in very cold weather at half past midnight without shelter for a bus which would appear ""some time"". The upside of the experience was that it wasn't raining or indeed snowing as it was cold enough for snow. What a wonderful Scottish welcome for the largely non Scottish bus load of passengers very few of whom including us had managed to find the bus stance without asking some one for directions. I have commended this airport because there is no alternative for many destinations - perhaps that is why they get away with poor service."
After reading the reviews here I panicked and purchased fast track security for a 0720 flight only to see people going through the regular queues faster than fast track which was only 5 min itself. Total waste of a fiver. Maybe an online traffic light system of how busy departures are and staffing levels would assist as there is no info on the website about how long to expect security to take.
"The ""old"" security system (ie: he one they had before this one) also had long queues but at least that seemed to be just due to passenger numbers. As others have pointed out the new system does not allow for any passengers who need more than one tray (ie: most as one wheelie/rucksack goes in one tray and laptop/ipad/phone/jacket etc in the other) - as the ridiculous numbered allocation of spaces on the belt before the x-ray means that there is virtually no way to keep multiple trays together. I can't even begin to imagine how a family of four would cope (and presumably won't come summer time). The automatic tray extractor after x-rays is similar to the ones at Heathrow but in this case just adds to the confusion. Worse is at the end you are supposed to take your (one) tray to an array of metal shelves to re-pack/re-dress - but once again this doesn't in any way allow for passengers with multiple trays - it is virtually impossible for one person to carry two trays across the gap to the re-pack area. Amazingly this system manages to make T5 and T2 at Heathrow look a model of security efficiency. When I went through EDI a few weeks back there were a lot of management-type people observing the chaos hope the brilliant PE minds can work a solution to this. Funny thing for them is that now no-one has time to shop or eat/drink as they get out of security just in time to make their flights so I guess the retail guys will be asking for lower rents come review time."
Airport security is shambolic. Simply the worst in the world I have experienced. You should never be put in a situation where you and your hand luggage possessions going through screening are separated lost to sight and reach the end of the screening process at totally separate times into a crowd of waiting passengers.
Terrible security system - agree with comments on here I lost site of my belongings which seem to divert to who knows where containing my purse passport laptop etc. I don't mind the searches that is good but what a dreadful chaotic system People all over looking for their bags. Would rather go back to the old way. I also agree with all the stairs had to climb after disembarking. This isn't an improvement it is the worst system I have seen at an airport.
For an International Airport serving Scotland's capital this airport is a disgrace. First impression of having to walk down stairs from the aircraft onto the tarmac and then hike back up into the terminal was extremely poor. Surely in the 21st century a developed nation can expect to have a jetway for transiting from aircraft to the terminal. Didn't see much of the terminal but again first impression is dark dingy and not overly clean.
If an airport is the portal and welcome to city Edinburgh leaves a very taste in the mouth. The airport both inside and outside is dirty with no effort taken or investment given to make the place visually attractive or welcoming. The terminal is dirty and very poorly maintained the urinals in the toilets have buckets to catch the leaks the terminal floor is patched and taped to cover up holes. Other faults are too numerous to mention here other than to say that third world nation airports are better managed and more welcoming and appealing than depressing poor affair. The Scots are known for being miserable and gruff the staff at the airport take this to new levels of achievement. Aberdeen airport is no better and the only common factor is that they are both owned and managed by the same operator!! I will not being this dump again and fully intend to take up the issue of zealous rude security staff with British Department of Transport. Nothing will be done of course because no really cares!
I travel round the world for work and have been in some great airports some mediocre and some terrible. But I have never seen such a stupid ill thought out moronic security system than the new one at Edinburgh. It's bad enough on your own - losing track of your mobile phone and other valuables as they sit somewhere out of site for anyone to help themselves to but I have also gone through it with a toddler and wife - then the experience is unbearable. Who thought having numbered spots on the floor was better than a queue? All of the family's belongings get split up on the belt as they disappear off into no man's land then you have to escape from the mass of people to go through the metal detector - with a 3 year old trying to escape. It is beyond doubt the worst design anywhere on earth. What smart alec thought they could redesign something which while sometimes tedious works efficiently in every other country on earth! I wait for them to be sued over lost belongings missed flights or someone just completely losing their temper!
Huge queue at the security hall at 6 o'clock this morning (Monday) queue snaked all the way back from bar code scanners to the escalators (i.e. a long queue to even enter the security hall). This is far from the first occurrence since the new security hall was opened but this now appears to becoming the norm at EDI during any busy time. Escalators were roped off with everyone being redirected to the stairs and lifts. Staff appeared to be doing their best and calling out for passengers on flights closing to come forward but some staff were clearly inexperienced and giving out wrong information - particularly the guy at the top of the stairs who told me that easyjet+ customers can no longer access fast-track which is just plain wrong. He maintained this even when I showed him the fast-track symbol on my boarding card. EDI has become an embarrassing shambles since the new security hall was opened
I use both Edinburgh and London City airports regularly and I used to consider them my favourites. Due to the new security processes introduced at both (they are owned by the same company) I am now beginning to hate travelling through them. Whoever thought the new security arrangements were a good idea was wrong wrong wrong. It is longer less efficient more frustrating than ever. At Edinburgh in particular it really makes passenger feel like cattle being herded. Truly awful experience - they should revert back to the old system.
Passenger pick up and drop off has gone from bad to much worse. The system changes about twice per year and each time it gets worse. Costs are ridiculous. Rip off is no longer the appropriate word. Thievery sounds better. The new security area leads to longer walkways. Not good for the infirm.
The experience in the new security area in Edinburgh airport was the worst we have experienced. How could anyone with any degree of intelligence have thought this was a good way to organise the security. Even though it was not busy my husband who has 2 artificial hips had to go through the search area as usual. This area was totally inefficient which meant that the queue was long and the time prolonged to ridiculous lengths. During this time all of his possessions including lap tops kindles passports wallets tickets are left unattended where any one could take them. This is unacceptable. The security man who was organising the area where our belongings are put onto the belt to go through security I would say was unpleasant. His idea of helping people who due to a language difference could not understand him was to shout louder and louder. I thought that there would have been adequate training for this type of bigotry and lack of intelligence. I agree with others who have complained about the enormous costs in the airport car park even for picking up. It is a total rip off. All in all I would not advise anyone to leave via Edinburgh airport if there is any other option.
I fly to Edinburgh almost every week (over 200 flights in the last five years) and agree with the other reviews that it is progressively getting worse. Every change seems to be designed to drive more revenue - parking fees increased taxi drop off changed so that the space can be used for valet parking new security to reduce the number of staff and create more space for shops. Presumably they paid a lot for the airport and need to squeeze out every penny of the poor travelling public (no point in calling them 'customers' even if they knew what they were). Even as you're queuing endlessly in security they're busy patting themselves on the back for being able to save another FTE from the security area with the new poorly designed system. I fly up from London City and if they wanted to see an airport that knows it has to look after its customers all they would have had to do was to fly down - maybe they missed their flight after getting stuck in security.
I find it absolutely ridiculous to have to pay £3 to pick someone up at the airport. It is bad enough to have to pay a pound however the time allocated even for a drop off can easily exceed the first 5 minutes per £1. It takes a lot longer to get someone in or out of a car with luggage especially if they are old infirm or a baby. This is a monopoly that is being exploited as there is no choice. Pick up and drop off should be free for the first 15 minutes.
I have travelled through Edinburgh Airport frequently for the last 10 years and have had no cause for complaint. On three previous (quiet) occasions I have used the new security area without any problem. Departing at 13.10 on Friday 6th of February introduced me to the chaos highlighted in these posts. It is beyond belief that airport management can get so many things so badly wrong all at once. I will be flying from Glasgow in the future.
The new security check area is a disgrace. You cannot see you bags and laptop etc as they pass through the scanners. Anyone could just steal your belongings and you wouldn't even realise until they were long gone. The long stay car park bus is another issue. It used to drop you off and pick up directly outside the terminal building. Now you have to walk the entire length through a multi-storey car park following a very poorly sign posted route. Edinburgh used to be a fantastic airport under BAA. Now it is one to avoid.
The biggest queue at Edinburgh Airport should be the one for the job centre as whoever made the decision on the new security hall needs to be fired almost 6 months later and there are still unacceptable details. You can of course pay for Fasttrak which really is false advertising. Come on team get it sorted or move over so someone can. Hate to think what it will be like in the summer.
The new security hall at Edinburgh is an absolute disgrace. Terrible customer service from the few staff that were there should and barking orders at travellers. Huge queues meaning that there was absolutely no time to even grab a coffee or go to the toilet before boarding the plane. The whole experience is just a piece of nonsense. I have travelled through many other European airports and none operate in such a poor way as Edinburgh. Unfortunately living in the east of Fife Edinburgh is convenient for air travel but if there was an alternative option I certainly would use it. The management team really need to get a grip of things.
This airport is a shambles! Felt intimidated and treat like a criminal at the security searching staff attitude was terrible with them being very abrupt with the orders being barked out. I found that the shopping area in the departure lounge was very good and that is the only positive about the airport. Anyway back to farce of the search team this needs addressed instantly as it is putting a lot of people off.
"I have travelled from Edinburgh airport about three times a month for the last 12 years and have generally found it to be one of the best airport experiences throughout the British Isles. All of this has drastically changed for the worse since the new security hall has been introduced. I have used it six times now and have had awful experiences on each occasion - massive queues slow process for tray loading staff being rather sharp with customers (probably because they are stressed too). The old security system was never really that bad but this new investment just isn't working. I was told yesterday that management have underestimated the staffing requirements and are actively recruiting. I am not convinced that this will solve all the issues. The actual operational process at the machines is where I believe the greatest hold ups are being caused. To top it all I was selected ""randomly"" yesterday when I went through the x-ray door. Historically this would have meant being quickly frisk- searched. However you now have to queue to go through a body scanner. This resulted in a further delay waiting to queue for the scanner. Not impressed. I am now beginning to consider driving to Glasgow Airport or using the train as there is no real sign of this improving. If it's like this in the quieter winter months I fear that it is going to be utterly unbearable in the summer holiday season. The management team at the airport should not be scared of reversing this dreadful decision and have a re-think about the best system to deploy. The current one is useless."
Used to like Edinburgh airport but having flown here on 18 December and back to Bristol on the same day I can honestly say it's deteriorated. The new security area is a shambles with long snaking queues and security personnel barking instructions to stand behind people on a circle on the floor whilst waiting to get near the belt to get a tray for your belongings. Very chaotic not enough trays coming down and mixed instructions adding to longer queues. Being barked at to move away at the other end whilst still trying to gather belongings isn't good either. Leave plenty of time as its elongated the security process!
Security bit is Horrible. Very long queuing. I travelled 3 times in the last month and each time was worse. 20th of December queues for security control were up to the mechanic escalator at the entrance of the airport. Arrived with 1 hour in advance to just go through security check and got stuck for circa 50 min at security line. Fearing I would miss my plane I had to ask staff to let me pass to the front and then run to barely make it to the flight Edinburgh airport used to be a pleasant experience with never more than 20 min waiting for security check. Now make sure you arrive to the airport no more than 1.30h in advance (only for security!) or you will be missing your flight.
I have used Edinburgh airport quite a few times in the past couple of years and am sorry to say the management need to address customer service because it is terrible. On arrival two weeks ago check in took over 45 minutes and there was only 36 people in the queue. There were two staff at the desk but one spent most of the time on the phone. After this we went upstairs to security which is a joke. Only two lanes open with hundreds of people waiting in line. Staff are off hand and rude. New security halls are coming into service which is great but why is there a need to provide such bad service at the old ones? Security needs to be done properly however surely more lanes can be kept open to get the passengers through. We arrived at the airport more than two hours before the flight and only just got on the plane with no breakfast and having spent not a penny in the fancy shops because there was no time left. Returning was no better. The plane disembarked onto the concrete and we were left standing outside the building in the rain for 15 minutes because immigration didn't seem to have its act together and we therefore were not allowed inside the building. This is supposed to be Scotland's flagship airport.
The queues at security are awful they don't have enough lanes open and they don't manage them well. Arrive early!
"Worst design for processing passengers through security. I travelled through the airport with 5 other staff members on 6 December 2014. The airport was not particularly busy but the security process was total chaos in spite of there being active ""queue managers"" trying to marshal the corralled passengers. This really has to revert to ""first come first served"". Lining 6 passengers up to put trays onto a belt could only ever work if they all put them on at exactly the same time moved away at the same time and then the next set of passengers replace them at the same time. I used to like Edinburgh airport but this is now so bad I would consider flying into Glasgow and getting the train over if I had future business in Edinburgh."
The new security hall is appalling staff do not appear to have been sufficiently trained in the use of the new equipment nor are there enough hand scanners for the staff. The scanning machines are over-sensitive they identified my ancient Kindle which has been through many airport security scanners without any problem as being a potentially hazardous device! Staff were unsympathetic to travellers' concerns that they might miss flights offering only obviously management authorised platitudes. The lack of information and assistance was disgraceful. My experience of the security hall was very early in the morning I shudder to think what it must be like when the terminal is at its busiest.
"Arrived at 5.40 am for a 6.45 flight. Had checked in online and had only hand baggage. Went directly to security where we were forced to wait outside closed doors for five minutes. Edinburgh is transitioning to a new security hall. The passengers who have already been through security in the new hall have to cross at right angles the passengers who have yet to go through security in the old hall. Their solution is to close the doors to the old hall let the ""new hall"" passengers cross then close the doors to the new hall and let passengers pile into the old hall. We were told not to go to the new hall but wait there for the old hall. So we waited. On entry we found an enormous queue of passengers and only two security lanes (plus fast track) in operation. This was rush hour at Edinburgh airport. There was no calling of passengers forward for flights that were already boarding it was a case of hurry-up-and-wait (and no information). The passengers were shirty the security staff were harassed and rude. Bottom line - despite being an hour early for my flight and only needing to get through security I missed my plane. I wasn't the only one - three of us converged on the boarding gate at the same time. The only alternative flight was towards the end of the afternoon so my trip was cancelled. Edinburgh security used to be a dream (10-15 mins even during rush hour). Now it's a nightmare. There's no information on the website to let you know to be very early for your flight. Fast-track might just be worth it although another reviewer's comment about the lack of fast track in the new hall suggests maybe not."
"I arrived at the Airport at circa 5pm on October 10th for a domestic flight. The existing security ""hall"" had literally just been closed to the pubic (still open for staff and flight crews) and we were all ushered into the new facility. New normally means better - at least that's what I thought. It was total chaos. There was no queue management leading into the new hall and several people almost came to blows as passengers who had paid for priority through security walked past the long (stretching all the way back to the escalators) queue searching in vain for the non-existent priority lane. Once I reached the top of the queue there was even more chaos this time caused by the fact that there was active queue management - mis-management would be more like it - and only 2 security scanners operational. Staff were shouting out that passengers should go to a numbered spaces to put belongings in trays for scanning. Guess what no numbered spaces just a line of plastic trays on a table staff on the actual security conveyor belt were highly aggressive and very rude they paid no attention to the concept of customer service and had no understanding that when you put your valuables in a tray you need to be able to see where that tray is to make sure that no-one reaches in and lifts things out. No doubt they were just as stressed by the shambolic operation of the new hall as we were but we are the ones who pay to use the facilities and need to be treated as valued customers. For the airport which would like to see itself as Scotland's premier airport and Edinburgh's gateway to the world it was a complete shambles and an utter disgrace. Those responsible for closing the existing facility during the day (on a very busy day at that) and making the passengers use a new facility which was woefully unready (only 2 of the lines were open!) should be sacked."
EDI-LHR Monday 22nd September. I arrived at 08.10 for a flight departing at 09.10 to find that what is normally no more than twenty minutes in the security queue stretched out to just on forty minutes. I know that a Monday morning will be busy but when I'd got through - with my flight starting to board - I could see that six of the twelve or so scanners were not in action. Hence the pandemonium. Really with the competition from a train to London this is an own-goal. The new tram stops next to the about-to-be-opened terminal extension but note also that for most of the day the bus will be faster and for casual traffic it is cheaper (£4/£7 return versus £5/£9 return).
We flew from Edinburgh Airport on 12th August at 8am in the morning. Ladies toilets were already filthy. The airport would do well using a customer experience consultant. How are you supposed to wash and then dry your hands in the Ladies toilets when you have your luggage and there are only two dryers and these are miles away from the sinks? The food outlet called Eat in the departure hall upstairs is always filthy and untidy and tables aren't cleared. The airport presents a consistently untidy and mucky experience all round.
I am aged on wrong side of 70 not a regular flyer. On return flight to Ireland on 11/09/14 I feel I was treated as no better by security staff (and I wholly approve of stringent security checks at airports) than a common criminal. The guy who checked me made me remove my shoes spread-eagled me and when he found I had failed to remove a few scraps of paper from my pockets dealt with me in a sneering and ill mannered fashion. Never again.
We flew from the airport on 16/08/2014 : the drop off area was dark and congested the departure hall is congested as people flying out are trying to find their check in desk and people arriving off flights are walking through the same area to exit the building - a total muddle. The security and hand luggage check area is like a cave (it is so dark) and is very muddled before and after you go through it. But what a difference when you enter the duty free and waiting area - bright and well organised space. We flew into the airport on 23/08/2014: in the ladies toilets there was one door with a broken lock and another toilet was out of action. It did not smell very fresh either. We seemed to be the only arriving flight as there were no other passengers going through passport control or baggage reclaim yet it took 15 minutes for any luggage to appear even although there was quite a delay in anyone being able to exit our plane after landing. We used to like using Edinburgh airport but in the last couple of years it has not been a very good experience.
Airport is a building site. Every time I have returned to this (my home) airport recently the airport via has been in a different place each time even further from the terminal. Presumably this is to remind is that no matter how much inconvenience and expense the tram in Edinburgh has cost us it is still not over. The tram of course takes far longer than the bus to get to the city centre so I imagine they believe by making the bus harder to find they will displace at least some passengers from the bus to this 1 billion Â£ white elephant. Not me. But clearly they care nothing for their passengers. The only ones who have a decent exit these days are being met by private cars.
Arrived on flight from Mexico on 24th July. Flight landed at 08.00 but we didn't get our bags delivered until 09.00. First bag was delivered from flight at 08.46 (after screens initially stating baggage delivery would start at 08.31). This was after being bussed from aircraft. General feeling amongst passengers was that there was not enough staff to cope.
Flew to Geneva on Monday 7 Jul on easyJet 18.00 flight. Through the boarding gate more or less on time and then spent 25 mins waiting in hot sun in a polytunnel at the SW end of the terminal building. Turned out we were waiting for a vehicle with a lift platform to assist a disabled passenger to disembark. Exactly the same thing happen to me about a year ago only that time it was a wheelchair that took 20mns to appear. Something wrong somewhere. I wouldn't care but I had just completed a passenger survey whilst waiting at the boarding gate and I gave the questions asked quite good marks. Mind you I am the one who told the survey that the gents toilets on the right when you come back home through passport control simply honk of stale urine. Sort it.
Arrived on flight from Milan on Saturday 28th June. Taken from aircraft by bus despite being on a stand within walking distance of terminal building. Then kept on bus for around fifteen minutes due to queues in passport control. Released off bus only to then spend 45 minutes in queue in a perspex tunnel in very hot temperatures because electronic passport readers were being trialled. No air-con no ventilation with older people and children being subjected to heat. This was unacceptable for a major gateway point to Scotland.
Arrived 20 minutes early on a Ryanair flight from Tenerife arriving 2300 hrs. Bussed from where aircraft was parked at other side of airport to find huge Q at immigration. Immigration automated passport readers were taking twice as long as human counterpart. Having only cabin baggage you hope for a speedy exit but with all the faffing about it was just after midnight an hour after the plane had landed we walked out of airport door. Passing through baggage reclaim I heard the duty manager trying to explain a luggage delay by telling passengers that their aircraft was early so if they have more than one aircraft prepare for delays. This is my local airport and I so want it to be good but the service at the moment for arriving passengers with buses stairs walking outside in all weathers incompetent immigration staff makes it Pathetic.
I flew to Edinburgh Airport from Exeter by Flybe on 28th April 2014. I have some limitations to my walking and was quite amazed to be directed of the plane to 2 flights of stairs to the arrivals area there then followed a very long walk to departure point with no walkways (only when you have to fly out of the airport are two sections provided). I have travelled by air to many destinations worldwide and usually find assistance if needed. Edinburgh is therefore a shock in that no assistance was offered and having stairs to climb with no alternatives make it a rather second rate airport. I'm quite surprised that no one working there from top management downwards has not recognised that they are around several decades out of date compared with other airports.
Flew into Edinburgh airport on 14th April 2014 from Bristol on easyJet and returned on 17th April. On both visits we were taken aback by the excellent customer service provided by the easyJet staff and staff from all parts of the airport even the chaps that searched our baggage. I would highly recommend anyone to use Edinburgh Airport. A bit busy but a few personal touches did not go amiss.
I think its a nice decent mid sized airport. Good location and has a very good number of flights to a variety of destinations.
This small airport is convenient to the city and is easy to navigate. Queue times were short though I can imagine the size of the security screening area to be a bit of a problem during peak times. Otherwise the facilities were good - especially airside and the bonus is that the airport has free wifi. A much nicer experience than most British airports.
Be careful of the fact that the three parking options for drivers picking up passengers from this airport are designed to fleece as much money as possible from you. Although road signage leads drivers to believe there is a Short Term parking area once trapped within a one way traffic system you'll discover there is only a £1.00 per minute drop off zone where you are not allowed to leave your vehicle unattended. Also despite the fact that the Long Term parking option (very far from terminals) says they offer 10 min of free parking they do not. The time on the ticket dispensed as you enter the parking is always one minute later than the actual time. Even if you return to the exit within nine minutes of entering this parking area the automatic ticket will bill you for more than ten minutes a minimum fee of £3.75. The exit ticket machine at the drop off zone does not accept 5 pence coins either. There is genuinely free parking at the ark and ride facility but this is in fact at Ingleston which is a 30 min walk from the terminals. Further more the police hide around a blind corner in the one way traffic system. This is convenient for catching drivers using their mobile phones due to the fact that they need to make contact with the people they are collecting after having to negotiate the day light robbery that is the parking system.
Large and decent passenger area after security. Security pushes passengers through quickly (bit too quick for my liking). Given no time to re-pack before being selected for silly body scan that needs you to twirl.
"Arrived from Nice mid day on Monday 7th October. Into the passport control area to a massive build up of people arriving from different places. The passport ""E"" area was not well directed and no signs to say this is for ""E"" passport holders only i.e. the new type so when my wife tried to go through that it didn't work and she was told to go into the line with all the others again. I have an ""E"" passport so took my place in the line stepped forward when called by the one female on duty and placed my passport on the screen nothing happened then a glass door opened. I stepped into the next area and stood and waited and waited but the next glass door didn't open so when I walked back to ask the solitary female duty person she said you must put your passport face down on the screen I said I did that that's how I managed to get in here. Cut a long story short it was shambolic to say the least and they need to get passport control officers on hand to explain to people how the new system works."
Lately I have used Edinburgh Airport to pick up and drop off guests. Bearing in mind the size of the parking area 15 mins for££2.50 is entirely inadequate. BAA must make 10's if not 100's of millions of pounds each year from parking in Edinburgh alone. It is nothing less than highway robbery and should be examined. I also have a theory why it takes so long to reclaim baggage. The longer the delay the greater the profit for BAA in parking charges. They have no incentive to improve.
Arrived EDI on a Sunday morning at 07.00. Long lines for check-in and they moved slowly. Security lines moved quickly and efficiently. Decent number of shops and restaurants and all looks spiffy post security. Serviceair lounge was basic and did not provide much comfort or food. Overall a good experience.
The queues at security on Sunday afternoons are horrific had this twice two months apart with many hundreds of people in a massive snaking line and it took over 40 minutes from starting the queue to getting through the scanners.
Edinburgh has improved greatly since I last used it (Pre-Sale). Check-In/Bag Drop times great and I like the bag weighing machines very helpful for those that need them. Queues at security were quite long but went very quickly. Good range of places to eat but not enough shops. The shops there are ok but too overpriced. Airport although it's been done up does look a bit tired.
Arrived back from Paphos last night (30/3/13) with easyjet which was 30 mins early. Then had to wait 1.5 hours for my baggage. This is not the first time that has happened to me at Edinburgh. Were they not expecting us? You would imagine that Scotland's flagship airport would want to make a positive impression on its visitors. Never had that experience at either Glasgow or Prestwick which I have used regularly over the years.
Arrived for an easyjet link up flight to LGW. Shuttle bus (5 mins) check-in (5 mins) coffee (15 mins) through to airside (5 mins) then a pleasant hour in nice relaxing atmosphere for an hour before boarding. On time flight. Airport is clean and efficient. On return from landing to collecting bags and getting car from park and fly took all of 20 mins.
Slowest baggage reclaim of anywhere. Constantly have to wait from 45 minutes to an hour for belt to start. I complained via email when it happened last week and was told it was because our flight was 30 minutes late it wasn't it was 15 minutes early. It is really poor and you could understand it happening now and again but it is constantly late with every flight I arrive on. Servisair need to get more people or get out and let someone with experience of an ever increasing passenger flow take over.
We arrived at 11.30pm on 25th Oct 2012 on a Ryanair flight from Tenerife. My son who is a wheelchair user and his fiancée who had an airport wheelchair and myself as their carer. After boarding last by the crew in Tenerife and being seated together at the back of the plane and ready for takeoff - we were then asked to split up due to Ryanairs policy for disabled passengers. My son was made to walk to the front of the plane and we had to be apart for the journey - never before have we had to do this with any other airline and were very upset. On arriving in Edinburgh my son was then taken off first (it was 4 degrees) on the outdoor lift and instead of coming to the back to collect us with the lift he was taken to another plane for a passenger and then back to our plane. By then he was a shivering wreck. I have travelled with my son and partner many times and never been treated so appallingly. I really think the staff should realise why the passenger is in a wheelchair and may need a bit more care. Once in the airport the assistant was great and took us speedily through passport collected our baggage and then to taxi rank.
Such a shame that Edinburgh is let down so badly by its baggage system. It is truly appaling - I arrive back into Edinburgh from various destinations once or twice a week and always wait for an eternity for my bag - just arrived home having arrived on a 45 min flight only to wait a further 40 for my bag. When the irate passengers begin to complain the staff are surly and unhelpful - shocking service.
Agree with previous comments about luggage retrieval at Edinburgh airport. It is without fail poor cannot understand why it always takes so long at such a small airport.
LHR-EDI 24 Sep. Agree with B Brockett below
On the face of it Edinburgh Airport has everything going for it. What a shame it cannot treat its passengers properly. Every time I make a trip most things go well that is until I arrive back at Edinburgh and I know my blood pressure is going to soar. It seems that they find it impossible to co-ordinate getting baggage off the plane and into the reclaim area without it taking an eternity. Yesterday it took only 40 minutes from me actually arriving in the reclaim hall for my luggage to appear - this was one of their better performances! I have waited on one occasion for over 1 hour! Contrast this to my visit last week to Naples in less than 10 minutes of exiting the plane I had my luggage and was on my way. When it comes to baggage reclaim this is without a doubt the worst airport I have ever visited.
Arrived on a BA plane from Gatwick got off baggage reclaim easy but on way back after check in there where no signs to security so we had to ask a BA Staff member where to go. And restaurant's were hard to find. Overall it was ok.
After a relatively smooth flight we got the usual Ryanair space at the furthest away spot at the terminal building. Obligatory buses were there to slow down the transfer - the first one couldn't leave until the second one was ready to go. No communication about how long it would take. I was bad enough that it took 15 minutes to get from the plane to passport control (we got through very quickly) only to arrive in the baggage hall where half a dozen bags came through and then nothing for 30 minutes. Again no communication. I can't help wondering about the customer care with airlines and airports. It seems to be missing at Edinburgh.
I travelled from here recently and I hadn't been there for a while and I was surprised how much it had changed. The staff were friendly and I was surprised how organised they were considering it was 6.30 in the morning! Going back to the airport itself it had just been done-up and they had opened the new low-cost departure lounge as well. Overall it is a great airport.
Used park and ride to airport which is an easy system. Baggage drop to airside took 10 mins. This airport is clean and simple to pass through. On return landing to car collection took less than half an hour and this included bag collection! There does seem to be an absence of customs. For non flying people no visible viewing places.
An easy airport to arrive at with just hand baggage off a UK domestic flight as one is quickly through the airport and there is a dedicated bus every 10 minutes to and from the city centre. Returning for my return flight I found only five out of the ten scanners at security in use despite being a busy holiday period. Queues to get through. Despite being very busy airside there are at least windows and seats so one can look out and watch the runway activity whilst waiting. Like most airports the food and drink outlets seem pricey but there is an airside Boots. There can be a bit of congestion with queues at several of the gates close to the central section of the terminal especially if it is an Easyjet flight where they are making people line up in the two columns left for Speed Boarding or right for the rest of us!
Still can't get over the drop-off and pick-up charges. Check-in queues are variable as usual. I don't understand the advantage of checking in online if I have baggage as I have to stand in a long queue anyway. Security clearance has improved and I found the staff extremely friendly. Passport control is much better although the slalom like barriers make me laugh. Luggage retrieval is haphazard - sometimes it's good but not if there are any other flights. They seem unable to cope with more than one flight at a time. Cost of parking is a nightmare here and the pick-up charge for pre-booked taxis is a rip-off. I would like to know what BAA are doing with the extra money they are getting from these charges.
We arrived back from Dubrovnik on a Sunday and were the only flight in the baggage reclaim area. The bags started to come through within 10 mins. However that was short lived several other flights arrived shortly after. Our bags were stopped and other flights luggage started to appear. We had to wait over one hour. During that time we saw several baggage handlers walk away. This is not the first time I have experienced this at Edinburgh Airport and it is a bad reflection on the service provided.
I've used Edinburgh Airport for trips to Amsterdam and to Brussels in the last week. Queues at security are short and relatively efficient staff fairly rude (but I find this typical of airport security anywhere). Airport is a good size: good range of shops and restaurants without having to walk miles to the gate. On arrival from Brussels on Sunday evening there was no queue at immigration. Bags arrived on the belt with 2 minutes. Toilets clean and well maintained. Short walk to the airport bus which is regular and good value. I was home in the centre of Edinburgh within 40 minutes of arrival on both trips. Used the car hire area twice in the last month for other trips: good range of providers.
EDI-LGW. 9.30 am flight. Line for BA was huge at the bag drop however we got to line jump as we were just going to London. Security was extremely slow at Edinburgh usually about 25 mins to get through pat downs and shoe checks for all. Airport much improved inside but bags are usually 25 min wait which seems like a long time as the plane is only a few metres away.
Departing for CGN. 10 minute queue for security (time of day 1100) better range of facilities than in the past. 15th May arriving from MUC at 1845. Ten minutes from plane to baggage to out the door! One point to note is that UK Borders Agency practice now includes fingerprinting you if you are not an EU national.
"My local airport so use Edinburgh frequently. However on recent international flights if you arrive on an evening flight at ""rush hour"" the airport really let's itself down. On a flight back from Paris in January the airport was not ready with steps even although the cityjet flight arrived at the designated arrival time - we had to wait 20 minutes to disembark which meant we hit immigration at the same time as 4 other flights. Took another 30 minutes to clear immigration (surly Immigration staff - you leave immigration feeling like a criminal). Now given that this was 50 minutes since arrival at the gate you would have thought that baggage would be on the belt but another 30 minute wait for Baggage to arrive. Given that BAA are desperately trying to attract new destinations and flights to Edinburgh they should look at the arrivals part of the experience first."
Arrived into Gate 11 used by BA short walk to baggage reclaim and out to airport bus to city. Very quick passing through airport. Return journey airport was busy as it was a Sunday night. Security worked well forgot to remove coins from pocket so set off alarm - security employee was polite & efficient in pat down. No queuing in toilets facilities appeared clean and plenty of seating. Overall a positive experience.
I travelled through Edinburgh on BA and Flybe flights. There was little in the way of queues at check-in but the main problem was at security. The queues were long and there was only one archway open for two scanners. The main downside of Edinburgh is the attitude of the security staff. They are officious and sometimes nasty. I believed that my first experience was a one- off but on the second occasion I formed the opinion that these people are not managed properly and should have lessons in how to treat the customer. It's a great shame as Edinburgh is actually a very good regional airport.
"Facilities at Edinburgh have recently been improved which basically means that there's more shopping and a lot less daylight in the departure lounge. In spite of this passengers using a boarding gate across from the business lounge inevitably block the passageway and access to the dozen or so gates beyond obviously space for shopping was more important than improving passenger access at this point. This gives the terminal an oppressive cramped feel already induced by the enlarged security area which has several more gates although no more are opened than before there merely being an even more intricate maze to negotiate to reach the actual security gates. The road in front of the terminal is being ""redesigned"" yet again. This is to enable the airport authorities to charge motorists for dropping off passengers in front of the terminal. This brazen grasping should be sufficient warning of the ethos of Edinburgh Airport."
Used Edinburgh 3 times for return trips in the last year. I agree with the comment about the strange approach roads. It is as if the airport is just part of some industrial park with farm houses and all sorts of businesses lining the road. The person collecting me on arrival most recently got confused and ended up in the wrong area due to poor signage. Efficient airport though but still feels a little cramped especially at the old gates (the ones where you turn left after Security) and at the check in. Check in has been fast every time so you don't need to remain too long in that busy area. Arrival has always been quick with no real queues to speak of in Immigration.
"Transport to airport on Airport bus £6 open return - good value swift service. The road layout in front of the terminals was ""improved"" about 18 months ago and is now chaotic making car drop-offs a pain. Check-in and security both swift. Departure area seems cramped as the terminal is undergoing yet another expansion. Facilities clean. Standard rip-off for bottled water."
"Used EDI for a city break on the continent. The approach roads which don't appear to have changed much in 20 years and the front of terminal area must be one of the worst in Europe for an airport this size. A complete shambles when the airport is busy. Does nobody in BAA ever look at airports in Europe and see what can be achieved? Immigration area is another mess three aircraft arrive at the same time and the queues are out onto the apron. Why not expand this area and why no ""Fast Track""? I notice that one of new traffic lights at the A8 roundabout has cunningly hidden the sign for Edinburgh and the Bypass. This doesn't help tourists trying to handle roundabouts and find their way out of the airport."
There has been a big expansion in service from this airport including Delta to JFK and Continental to EWR. The airport itself now also needs to expand. I found it to be very busy with arriving and departing passengers not clearly separated. Plenty of facilities however.
This was my first time using Edinburgh Airport. Departing Edinburgh was a decent experience. However the queues for passing through security were not so good. It took us 10 minutes to check-in with nearly all of the airport staff helpful and polite apart from one young staff member in his twenties who was swearing and cursing at passengers under his breath. Then we got something to eat before clearing security. It seems that at Edinburgh there are more shops and places to eat before security so if you are planning to eat- get something before security. Going through security took about 15 minutes- even with all of the screens being used. Slowly we got through. Boarding the plane was quick- although we departed about 15 minutes late due to missing passengers. Returning to Edinburgh was poor. We arrived at midnight and got off the plane quickly- but clearing immigration was pathetic- why do they make you walk round and round before reaching the desks? After clearing immigration we had to wait and use the same baggage belt as another full flight even when the other belts were not being used! This meant we ended up waiting over 45 minutes to collect our bags. I understand that it was midnight and there would be less handlers on duty- but 45 minutes is a disgrace at any airport- especially an international one like Edinburgh. I think Edinburgh airport is a good one (despite the wait to collect our luggage) - the signage is clear and well designed making the airport easy to navigate. The toilets were clean too. It is clear that Edinburgh Airport needs expanding in the future.
FlyGlobespan to Barcelona. Check in helped by extra desk being opened to handle full flight - good service to the passenger to see this and help the system. Security moving very quickly and staff assisting with directions for shortest queues. Departure from recently opened gates which are a long walk from the check-in desks so allow this if you are late arriving at the airport. These gates have cafes and shopping close by so no need to queue at the shops etc in the main hall. Expansion work to double the size of the departure hall is ongoing but this seems not to impact the lounges etc. On return luggage on belt before the passengers were of the aircraft - another good service from Edinburgh.
Flight with easyJet to STN from EDI. Used off airport parking service so avoided higher airport parking fees - recommend this as the airport charges are high in comparison. Early morning check in - no long queues. 2 items of baggage dropped. Staff helpful and prompt. Straight through to dept. lounge. No delays at security plenty of staff and assistance to quickest security point. Not very busy as most commuters had departed which is the mainstay of business for Edinburgh. Plenty of seating whole facility clean. Times and gates clearly advertised on electronic screens close to both gates and in waiting areas. Bar and cafes had no queues. Shops looked busy but prices are still not the real bargain as they once were for duty free. Internet access on pay as you use desks in dedicated area if wanted. On return to EDI quite long walk to enter building as aircraft stand some distance form main building but all at ground level and under cover. Bags on belt quickly. A good service and happy to recommend the facility.
Edinburgh airport is a small regional airport and is one of the best I've been in. Check in was quick and efficient as usual. Land side there was a number of shops and a newly opened/refurbished food hall which was clean and well maintained. We were able to pass through security within 3 minutes without any problems. The first thing I noticed airside was that all the windows had been boarded up making the gates look dull with poor lighting. I initially expected this had been done for security but I found out that they are currently increasing the size of the lounges and they will be opened in phases between 2009 and 2010. Virtually the same facilities are available airside as landside so I wouldnt bother spending anytime landside and go straight through.
Dropped off couple of yards from entrance by Edinburgh Park and Fly so no problems or hold ups for travel to airport (Edinburgh is having some major roadworks in the city centre at present that could affect journey times out to airport (8 miles) until maybe 2010) or with on site parking rates (make sure you use the correct car park for the duration of stay or use an off airport service for better rates). Busy on a Monday morning but no queue at check-in which is ground floor then upstairs to dept. lounge. Joined security queue at 10.05 out to lounge at 10.25. Most gates being used no real hold ups just number of pax. Signage in lounge quite clear on overhead electronic boards. Avoid the duty free shops though - still high priced compared to many other airports. 3 coffee bars and cafes if wanted. Sufficient seating for number of gates. Some wifi available if needed. Pleasant airport to use - fine for the volume of business and though looking to expand the operation at present the lounges can cope well with the volume of pax.
Old and sad inside. It has a small feel about it and this makes it quite crowded. The land side is pretty poor and check in is not good. Once through to airside it is also pretty spartan and as you approach the gate give up all hope of creature comforts.
I am a regular user if Edinburgh airport and find it a pleasant experience. I do however have three moans - baggage delivery can be very slow. Recently even though I was last off the plane I noticed that there were still no baggage handlers in the vicinity so obviously there was going to be a delay. Short term car park is very expensive and makes picking up people expensive as well.
I was pleasantly surprised with Edinburgh Airport. Flying to Milan-Malpensa return I found security speedy yet thorough and the Departures Lounge was comfortable with loads of seating and a good selection of reasonably priced bars and shopping facilities. Toilet facilities very clean and tidy. Checking-in and boarding was also quick and easy. Generally the airport has a very comfortable and welcoming feel.
EDI-LHR T1. From the check-in kiosk to clearing Security was this time 20 minutes but that owed a lot to the time of day (0800) and this time of year. The queue this particular day was a long one but they worked hard to keep it moving. However I don't see where they could add additional security screening capacity - short of taking out two shops to provide some sort of Business Fast-Track.
From the bag drop (had checked in online) to past security and airside was a shade over ten minutes and this at 1630. Can't really complain about the airside facilities or indeed much else. On the return leg the baggage was at the carousel by the time we had got there. The only problem was being held up by the bus service for twenty minutes because they couldn't get it to restart and a whole bus load of pax and their luggage had to change to another vehicle (but this is a Lothians Buses problem). Otherwise I still rate it a very good airport in the 5m - 10m passengers per year category.
I have not used this airport as frequently as some commentators but I was recently there and disagree with some of the previous comments. True it is busy and needs additional facilities also the shops and restaurants are usual BAA fare but there was plenty of seating and information was good - my outward flight was delayed but not really due to the airport (the local weather was poor when it appeared very good everywhere else in Britain). My real disagreement is with transport links there is a bus to the city centre every 10-15 minutes which costs £3 and when I used it took less than 20 minutes which seems as good as any other airport I know of in Britain. Obviously it will take longer when the traffic is busy however there is much publicity about a tram to link the airport and city to be opened in a couple of years so it is not really fair to say the problem is not being addressed (albeit rather late).
Unfortunately I have lost confidence in Edinburgh Airport. The last few years have seen it improve a fair bit from where it came from. However there has been a period of growth over the last year or so and the airport is struggling to cope. The transport links to the airport are poor and appear to be getting worse. There is no word of any investment into improving the traffic problems in the area either. I also find the queuing times in Edinburgh mean that the time spent in the airport is no longer enjoyable while it seems that delays hit the airport more and more. I travel to Heathrow often and use Edinburgh but it would appear that whenever a flight is to be cancelled it is from Edinburgh. Leaving us passengers late for business meetings. Coming from Kirkaldy Fife I am delighted to see the upturn in Dundee's airport and I will certainly be using Dundee as opposed to Edinburgh from now on.
Despite the increase of passengers in the recent years Edinburgh Airport remains still a small and cosy airport. There are however few issues which could be improved
Coming home from a 7 month trip (looks like I was the last reviewer) via a long distance flight during a snow storm is not fun. Thankfully I live in Edmonton where they know how to handle the weather/keep the runways clear. The only delay in landing was that the bridge connecting to the plane had trouble securing due to icing. Other than that we were off the plane quite quickly. Immigration had about 5 booths open and was only a 10 min wait. Issue with the baggage carousels in that the info telling us which one was ours was only up for 2 minutes (while we were waiting to get through customs) and then for some reason it disappeared which was quite confusing. Airport staff was waiting past the customs area to help passengers with connecting flights.
June 24th 2014 outbound. Seems like a new airport with all the renos. Very clean lots of stores tons of plug ins (including usb) and varied seating (standard gates plus loungers foot stools etc). Security was a bit of a lag due to training but staff were very friendly and seemed to be enjoying their jobs. If you have issues walking highly suggest getting a wheelchair as it can be a bit of a trek to get to some of the gates.
Great airport. Ideal if you are connecting to the United States. There are lots of services shops and restaurants. Easy to spend time during a connection. The US and Canadian customs are nice and efficient (much nicer than Calgary's dingy space).
Nice New facilities in south terminal. The rest of this review is less complimentary. Even with delayed flights security closes in the afternoon with some delayed flights not departing for 5 hours after security closes. It ruined and ended our trip to Phoenix in Nov 2012. A nightmare after enduring an all day wait for a US Air flight with maintenance issues. Even though we were checked in at the airport 2 hours prior to the original departure time of our flight a US Air employee at the gate instructed security to refuse us admittance. I would suspect that US Air had over booked the flight and had given our seats away even though we checked in 7 hours earlier and had not gone through security yet. Having rules in place that force passengers through security into a lounge area that leaves a lot to be desired is awful service by our airport. Almost everything today with air travel is set up to benefit the airline and the airport financially and the passenger's needs or interest is kicked to the curb. You don't have to think long before accepting the 7.5 hour drive to Great Falls Montana to fly for 1/3 the cost.
Edmonton's International Airport is lacking a lot of international destinations. I find most times easier to drive to Calgary and fly out of there.
Very modern. Arrivals level could be updated. I would expand the arrivals level to the east expand the departures level over the road and build a new road accessing the departure level. Security is efficient and the hold areas are great.
The arrivals lobby looked dated but was clean. The Edmonton Sky Shuttle is a regular bus service that runs from the arrivals lounge to various hotels across the city. It took an hour to get downtown but this may depend on the traffic and number of stops. It isn't the cheapest way to get downtown but there aren't any cheaper alternatives. The departures area is modern and functional. Some staff at the duty free shops seemed miserable a trend I spotted at other Canadian airports. Other than that the airport is fine but I wish they put a direct rail link to the downtown area.
After a delightful vacation to the US myself and my wife were unprepared for the rude unfriendly petty bureaucracy of Canada Customs at the Edmonton Airport. We were treated rudely and treated like petty criminals rather than citizens. Could these customs people possibly smile and welcome you back home? After long tiring flights home it is depressing to have to be treated in such a miserable fashion by customs people who have all the charm of Soviet border guards. These petty bureaucrats with their 5 minutes of power need to be replaced by people who are friendly and welcoming. They are an embarrassment to our City and likely harm this City's business and tourist reputation.
Connected through Edmonton to Calgary from London Heathrow. I was not impressed at all. The departures area is grimy hot noisy and smells like a dirty hotel. The airport is badly signposted and the International Arrivals/Immigration area is a joke. It took almost an hour to clear Immigration - only about 4 CBSA officers and they interrogated everyone as if we were criminals instead of citizens coming home. Next time I'll fly straight to Calgary - they are used to International flights there (obviously get more than 2 a day) and the CBSA agents are efficient.
YEG-YYC return. YEG makes Calgary's airport look like a frumpy bus terminal. What 's with only one restaurant airside in Calgary? Anyone connecting with a choice of either Edmonton or Calgary would be very wise to choose Edmonton International
I think that the airport is overall satisfactory. However I do believe from using YEG Airports Facilities that they should try to make the airport more appealing such as Vancouver International Airport. Nevertheless I do think it's a good enough airport to get the job done. Besides with it's expansion expected in being completed in 2012 they will have a total of 30 gates expanded parking lot office and retail space new control tower more baggage claim carousels etc.
As a resident of Edmonton who often has to travel to Calgary for business the commute to the airport from downtown or any further north is excessive. Frankly when you include the extra time you have to build in for check-in and security it is faster to take the Red Arrow bus service from downtown Edmonton to Calgary northside then take their shuttle to the Calgary airport. The busses are confortable have free wireless internet and plug-ins and there is no need to deal with the miserable Air Canada agents and steward(ess) staff. If I cannot get a direct flight from Edmonton to my destination I prefer taking the bus to Calgary as it is much less troublesome to catch the flight in Calgary. EIA the local airport authority is trying their damndest to completely close the Edmonton City Centre Airport which is much more convenient for business and personal commuter travel from both Calgary and northern Canada forcing people to pay exorbitant taxi fees and spend excessive time in both travel and waiting time. Very poor service yet expensive for an underserviced location with lousy parking and pickup facilities.
"In retort to R Wright R Skermer and Rob McMann comments I have been a business traveler for many years in Edmonton. I used to fly out of the Muni (City Center Airport) and connect in Calgary and Vancouver to my destinations. Since consolidation over 10 years ago I do still have to connect in Calgary or Vancouver to the following destinations but now endure a 45-minute drive. Edmonton International Airport has only one destination in all those cities London. It is much easier to fly direct from Calgary or Vancouver then connecting in London. As I live north of city the ""new freeway"" is still very far from being completed. Their are several over passes/bridges and lanes to be completed so it is far from complete. I do not have any complements for the Edmonton International Airport. I find it to be inadequate and lacking in service."
In response to D Scott's comments on the lack of access to YEG. He says the freeway by-passing the city won't be completed for many years. It is actually complete and has been for many months.
The facility is not that far out and actually commiserate to many airport drives I get throughout North America. It is clean efficient friendly and probably the easiest airport to get in and out of that I have experienced in a long time. I actually look forward to using it when I travel. I get a choice of Delta Northwest Air Canada Westjet Horizon United US Air and a gaggle of smaller and charter airlines. As the numbers grow and the $1 billion expansion takes hold this place will continue to explode with activity. I am as happy as a clam that I no longer have to use Calgary as a connection point to get anywhere. This airport has the directs to where I need to go and single connections at US and other Canadian hubs for the other destinations that are not direct. This facility has made the reality of re-locating back to Edmonton possible. Now for more post- security non Cara amenities please.
Daily scheduled service to US cities from YEG: Chicago Denver Minneapolis Salt Lake City Phoenix Las Vegas Los Angeles San Francisco Seattle. Mexico City daily scheduled European: London. Travel to airport from north side - via completed ring road to St Albert Trail - not many years away completed.
I've flown in anD out of Edmonton for a number of years. The last time I noted that the airport on both sides is very cramped for space. Mr Scott is correct in saying that it is best to catch international flights in Calgary. The airport is a distance from the city. For a city that has a metro population of over one million this airport does not meet its needs. All be it Calgary is a hub city and Edmonton is not. Looking at the statistics it is apparent that Edmonton's air traffic is growing. Over all though Edmonton International is a clean facility with good to excellent amenities.
"Just reiterate for K Lucht benefit. I stated that American Continental United and Delta do not fly into Edmonton. Had they bothered to read the next sentence I mentioned that ""United and Delta do fly the regional carriers in"" These are small 50-70 passenger regional jets. The seasonal flights they speak of are charters. Not schedule flights. Recently Zoom Airlines have pulled out of Edmonton as well. The point of going to Calgary was the cheaper and better selection of flights available."
It is well laid out and things are generally close together avoiding the requirement to walk vast distances to get to/from your gate. There are good amenities available once you're past security if you want to get something to read or something to eat. And the Air Canada lounge at Edmonton is very nice indeed -- definitely the place to be if you have to spend a few hours between flights. The airport is a way out of Edmonton proper and getting there involves a slow drive through downtown if you're from the north side. Also in my most recent trip there it took about forty minutes to get through the security checks. I had allowed what should have been plenty of time before my flight boarded but it ended up being barely enough. I don't know if my experience is the normal situation but if it is the security facilities and staff should be beefed up to handle the amount of traffic.
Not sure what D Scott or S Petersen are talking about. US Airways Horizon Northwest United and Delta all serve the airport. International destinations include Punta Cana Mexico City London and seasonal Amsterdam and Frankfurt service. These are in addition to other destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. The airport though small is clean and efficient and Edmonton Airports is working to improve the shopping and food options throughout the airport. A 180 mile drive to Calgary would not make sense for most travelers.
Quiet and small is how I would describe Edmonton International Airport. It is a bit of a drive from the north side of the city. They are building a new freeway to avoid driving through the city but it will not be completed for many years so you are looking at least an hour drive. Hardly any flights going to major US cities. Small regional jets fly most of these. Not served by American Continental United or Delta although United and Delta do fly the regional carriers in. As far as International flights to Asia or Europe best go to Calgary or Vancouver. Air Canada has only one flight to London and that’s it. I do find the Airport Improvement Fee a joke. $15.00 added to my ticket for what? A few restaurants and no parking.
Recently connected in Edmonton while doing Vancouver-Fort McMurray and back. Airport was clean modern and busy! Shops are limited understandable due to it's size. Staff were friendly and the terminal had a nice open feel to it. Edmonton is much easier to connect in compared to Calgary because it's simply more customer friendly and it makes these long day trips less stressful!
Not much of an airport. Very few international flights (one to be exact). Located far from downtown Edmonton almost a 45-minute drive. Found it easier to drive or fly further south to Calgary where flights were cheaper and much more abundant. Airport was not crowded a least. May have to do with lack of flights.
I connected here while flying between London and Vancouver on Air Canada. Very nice airport! Staff were very nice and helpful. Airport is spotless and very modern. Maple Leaf Lounge was great even better then some airlines' hub's lounges! Overall an excellent experience. I will fly through Edmonton again if the direct flights to Vancouver are full and who knows I might even want to make a stop here!
I recently flew into YEG after not flying there for several years. The expansion project is now complete and the airport looks great. It is airy and functions well. However all flights to the U.S. clear US customs at the airport prior to landing in the U.S. This works well except that if you arrive early you are made to wait in US customs waiting area that has too few seats. Most people had to stand for the 45 minute wait. The duty free shop is somewhat limited so that is only worth a five minute distraction. Once you clear customs you are also restricted to a certain set of gates and you are not free to wander the airport. There is only one little food shop with outrageously priced food ($7.50 for a small sandwich). So for US bound passengers you are segregated from the rest of airport with very few services which is really too bad as the rest of the airport is great.
I often travel into and out of YEG and never have I had a negative experience there. The decor is beautiful and it has a wonderfully open feel to it. It's the only airport I've ever been to where if you've travelled on a domestic flight you collect your luggage in the public arrivals hall. I'm happy to see that Air Canada is beginning flights to London out of YEG this fall. It's about time there's a scheduled service between Edmonton and Europe. Hopefully Frankfurt will soon be added making it easier for Star Alliance passengers flying with Lufthansa. If there's one thing that could use improvement at YEG it's install more automatic check-in machines as the queues seem to be continually growing larger.
I fly through YEG very often. On the plus side it's easy to get around and the public areas are clean and comfortable and for me the ice cream sandwich vending machine is a nice touch. On the minus side the washrooms are almost alway filthy. The $40+ cab ride to downtown is quite the hit as well when they shut down the muni they talked about an Edmonton Express Transit Bus but that was a no show they talked about increased capacity and frequency of Skyshuttle but that doesn't seem to have materialized either.
I'd certainly echo all the positive comments on the ambiance of Edmonton International. The decor including the beautiful forests and fields surrounding it the air quality natural lighting and remarkably polite/efficient staff all contribute to the atmosphere accentuating the excellent layout and organisation of the building itself. Indeed I feel it contains the most comfortable terminal space I've yet experienced. On its less than strong points It would be improved with more restaurants and it really needs better service to Europe.
Edmonton International Airport is a wonderful mid-sized facility. After its expansion and renovation the airport now sports a brilliantly clean modern open and airy look that is refreshing after coming off a long flight. 3-story atriums with vaulted ceilings and floor-ceiling windows mark the wide and rarely-crowded departure halls. Services at the airport are also impressive for a facility of its size with many good shops and restaurants and great touches like an observation deck free power outlets and desks for those with a laptop. I also like this airport for its lack of crowds (with exception to the mornings). Compared to the maddening masses at the big hubs Edmonton is one airport which has actually not maxed out its capacity yet but has in fact already built to accommodate further growth. The only downside is the distance to the city. A taxi can cost over C$40 (US$32) though there are shuttles which charge less than half that and when push comes to shove it very rarely takes over 35 minutes to get downtown.
I was through Edmonton Int'l Airport a few weeks ago for the first time in about 8 months. I was shocked at the improvement. It is extremely well-lit and spacious. Very easy to clear security and move around post-security. The only things lacking were decent shops and amenities. But for a small airport they're certainly adequate.
I was slightly apprehensive about centralizing security for both terminals but have been pleasantly surprised. The security check is actually quicker than it used to be and the boarding area is inviting and comfortable with some nice shops and services. (Love the fireplace!) Just one thing for the whiners who insist there's only room for one international airport in Alberta - could you please try to cite a reputable source in the future?
The new Edmonton International terminal is beautiful but comes at a price of $15 added to your domestic airline ticket (the taxes on air travel in this country are absolutely ridiculous). The terminal has a lovely fireplace area is spacious and welcoming. AC check in kiosks are great wonder why more people don't use them and stand in a line instead? Security was quick and friendly and they did an explosives test on my backpack and wanted to know my personal info. (kind of alarmed me). Luckily the airport has retained a viewing area although it is not as wonderful as the one in the older terminal. Shops and restaurants abound.
The new terminal is spectacular. Also very efficient. The number of flights and usage of the airport is increasing (unlike Calgary or Vancouver) hence the time is just right for a new terminal.
The new terminal in Edmonton is very pleasant. One wonders however why this terminal was necessary as it seems completely underused. Just because a new terminal is built does not mean that the flights will come. There is only room for one airhub in Alberta and that is Calgary (unfortunately). The security is admirable to the point of ludicrous.
I recently visited Edmonton International Airport when I was travelling up north from the United States. I was presently surprised by this modern airport and the ease of moving from the passenger terminal to the car rental facilities. Compared to other airports I have visited in Canada and the United States Edmonton's had a very up scale feel to it. I wish there were more flights operated out of this airport.
As the previous reviewer noted Eilat airport terminal is in the centre of the city and surrounded by hotels: I didn't believe the taxi driver for a few seconds when he dropped us there! Once inside we got a thorough grilling by security and our bags swabbed throughout for explosives. I think we got extra attention as foreigners but the female security official was very friendly and jovial - much nicer that the humourless officials who you normally meet. Checkin and hand baggage checks were quick and easy as the only flight was our 72-seater Arkia departure. There is a shop/cafe on both landside and airside parts but we didn't get a chance to try either. Overall it does the job well - just be prepared for the security.
The airport closes at night and there is no way for passengers with a delayed flight to sit inside or even have access to a toilet. Phone calls were unanswered.
We 3 older ladies flew on Sunday 31/8/2014 with Wizzair to Kracow. We got into a snaking queue at Eindhoven Airport. There were several other flights at the same time. Ours had been delayed by another hour. 20.00 there was only one security check! With hundreds of people trying to get through security. The flights were called out as boarding! There was a scramble to get through and a panic scenario! People pushing and shouting! It was awful! I really don't need that at the start of my holiday. Poor organisation and bad planning.
Cheap tickets but a lot of inconveniences. One of the major ones is that there is no passenger dropping area (Kiss and Ride). You may get easily a traffic ticket for dropping passengers in the yellow painted sidewalk area.
Proven to be an excellent local airport for travelling around Europe whilst on exchange in the Netherlands especially with Ryanair and Transavia using it heavily so cheap prices guaranteed. Flown to Seville Budapest and Prague through this airport recently. Admittedly it is a bit of a shed but it is apparently undergoing major work and has been for over a year. My advice is to do everything you want before security because the last time I used this airport even the Duty Free was closed for refurbishing. No airbridges or really any queues quiet and efficient. If there are more than two flights within a short period it gets very busy at security though.
Disorganized airport in the middle of nowhere. Currently a construction site. No air bridges walk to and from aircraft.
Overcrowded waiting rooms lacking sufficient seat facilities. Uninterested personnel. Volume and understandability of messages are inadequate. Unclear directions where and when to pass the security and customs. Together with fellow passengers we succeeded in finding out. We were called for boarding while the passengers of the former flight of our plane were not even yet de-boarding. So we had to queue for another unnecessary hour. Exaggerated intimate search at the security. They seem to lack the customary electronic equipment to detect metals at Eindhoven. The parking lot machine accepted neither Meastro card nor chip card. Fortunately I was warned for that. Otherwise I could have walked for another 2 Kms back to the arrival hall for cash. Picking-up passengers is seriously discouraged. Sidewalks near the arrival hall are supplied with yellow curbstones and crush barriers. Military police watches sharply that nobody stops for boarding a car.
I departed from Eindhoven this year. It was a very comfortable airport. But the only disadvantage was the airport is closed in the evening. At the flight back from Heraklion we had delay. Eindhoven was closed when we should arrive. We had to go to Schiphol instead.
I fly from Eindhoven frequently and it really is more of a pleasure to use than bigger airports such as Heathrow or Schiphol. It's small and check in times can be as little as 30 mins for smaller airlines like VLM although more time is necessary for Ryanair or Transavia as they use 737s. My only gripe is that the airport staff usually seem more concerned with gossiping or talking on their personal phones than dealing with customers (even passport control - I was once waiting there for 5 mins waiting for him to finish talking and he was the only one on duty). This really lets down what is otherwise a great little airport.
Nice modern small airport with friendly staff. When it is raining you get very wet walking to the aircraft. Restaurant and observation deck at first floor are very comfortable. Clean modern toilets and relaxed atmosphere all over the terminal. Parking facilities could be improved. Perfect bus connection to Eindhoven train station.
Eindhoven was nice. Parking in front of terminal 1 minute walk. Straight towards check inn. In the transit zone a good shop for food and drinks. Enough comfortable seating in the boarding areas. Clean toilets. No security or gun toting SWAT teams around. Very relaxed atmosphere.
If you fly out there with low cost airlines it would not be a problem if your arrive 45 minutes before departure everything is done in a smooth and efficient way there.
6I just love Eindhoven Airport. It is small but very friendly and has a nice atmosphere. Good connections to the rest of Holland (by motorway) and the busses leave regularly. Also they have a nice cafe with a good view and you can still light a cigarette in the departure hall (under one of those big umbrellas and in the restaurant in certain sections).
Eindhoven what a pleasant surprise. The perfect size resembles Dublin Airport when I was a child & it was far from the dreadful claustrophobic sprawl it is now even before they hid the baggage trolleys. Eindhoven is open and low-level clean everything within sight and well signposted. Any instructions for vending machines and storage lockers were so minimal and clear that it was stress- free. The staff are so genuinely pleasant and friendly it amazed me. Smoking stations to stave off the panic so reassuring to view through the glass partitions. Clean comfortable seating a really nice roof terrace from which you can watch the planes land plenty of room inside the air-conditioned restaurant a reasonably-priced varied menu free reading material. Train station nearby. Oh why can't all airports be like this? (Taxis in the Nederlands overcharge amazingly
SVO-SVX-HEL. Arrived mid morning from Moscow on domestic flight. There seem to be a good number of piers to allow access to the terminal building. Airport in the middle of being fully upgraded with building work everywhere estimated to be finished some time in 2014. Arrival was via various corridors that would not normally see passengers but the luggage was on the belt when we got there and then out into Arrivals. Airport not that busy so things seemed to run OK. Early morning Check-in for departure required basic suitcase scanning before Check-in which seemed a little slow. Security Scanning perfunctory - no need to get laptops out and shoes off with minimal queuing. Facilities in Departure Lounge limited but sufficient. Free WiFi available which was OK. Boarding directly via pier smooth.
Used to be very busy in the Soviet times since then reduced the traffic by at least 300%. At the same time the new terminal was built with more adequate waiting spaces. It is rather modern and clean. Food service is kind of slow. Public transportation to the city is not on top: and I used park-n-fly only once.
Modern airport surprisingly efficient compared with some other internal Russian airports. Arrival facilities good baggage on the conveyor without a long wait. On departure check in facilities were good security efficient and the Skyteam business lounge was of a high standard with free Internet connection although all drinks etc had to be paid for.
Lovely small airport with one of the best views of any I've ever visited. About 20km from the town but generally one plane at a time so queues transport etc not really an issue. Great coffee bar - go upstairs for views to die for (coffee is also good!). Planes can go early and beware of the winds when leaving. Sympathetically installed to harmonise with landscape (as much as an airport can!). Still need to pay in cash a departure tax - about 5GB Pounds. Also don't carry fresh food in hand luggage even if on an internal flight - it will be confiscated on arrival due to some strange Argentinean regulations.
I've lived in El Paso for two years now for school and I often use the airport to visit my hometown as well as other destinations. The busiest I've ever seen the airport from the time of walking through the doors checking baggage going through security and getting to my gate was about 40 minutes (Christmas vacation time). I've even got through in 20 minutes. It's a smaller airport with only one terminal that's ever used and about 10-15 gates (so from security to walk to your gate takes maybe 4-5 minutes). This isn't one of the airports you'll need to devote 2 hours in order to get through it. I'd say 1 hour is fine (because you never know even if it does only take 30 minutes to get to your gate) and maybe 1.5 during busy holiday times or if you're going to have to check the whole family (might even be 2 hours for that).
This airport was a small typical airport for a city of this size but it seems to be really under used. Very little planes are seen taking off or landing when driving by this airport. The terminal is quiet and peaceful so don't arrive too early. Overall a pleasant experience. The only problem I had is how there is no shade at the curbside area so be warned about that. Other than that I don't have much to complain about.
Modern new airport. Many hotels nearby almost within walking distance. Fort Bliss borders and shares airport runway with civilian airport. Many military personnel fly out from this airport. Security departing second visit slow planned for 1 hour to get through security and needed it. If you plan to travel across the border to Juarez by car 10 minutes to get to border from airport. Plan one to two hours for return trip back across border because of US custom check. Encounter one waitress in El Paso who could not speak English. Depending where you are in Juarez you can get by with very little Spanish.
Small airport with a southwest theme much like ABQ. All the employees were speaking spanish instead of English so I wasn't sure which side of the Rio Grande I was actually on! The airport is easily navigable and shuttles to hotels were readily available. No problems besides Spanish being the unofficial language.
A new terminal has been built but was not yet open so I used the old facilities. Arrivals area was a simple open-sided area of the main building. Check-in took place in a single room at the other end of the building. At the x-ray scanner an operator gazed in the general direction of the monitor screen. The main hall had no AC not even a fan and had a very oppressive atmosphere. Baggage handlers man-handled checked bags out through a back door. After checking in most passengers seemed to go back outside where it was much cooler. The waiting lounge had decent seating some air-conditioning unappealing bathrooms and no shops - it was quite full as there were two flights departing. Flying from Ende was an interesting experience but I think the new terminal will remove a lot of what makes it special.
"By far the worst airport experience I have ever had. Yes it is clean, new and modern but these were the only good things about it. There were at least 12 flights within the space of an hour and then nothing for the next 3 or 4 hours, the result, total chaos! I think there were literally 5 or so security lanes serving what would have been probably 2,500 passengers in an hour. We got to the airport about 2 and a half hours before departure and queued for almost 2 hours to get through security! Some people were panicking and trying to jump the queue as their flights were being called, but rightly so the passengers near the front stopped them. It's the only time I've ever had to run for a flight in my life. Turned out they were still missing over 50 passengers on the flight as they were still stuck in the terminal. Consequently Thomas Cook had to delay the flight. The airport shouldn't allow so many flights to go at once if it's totally incapable of handling them all. If you somehow manage to go at a quiet time though I'm sure it would be a very nice airport!"
This is the worst run airport we have ever encountered. On landing the queues to get through passport control were totally unacceptable. Five or six planes landed at once and only about 3 desks open. Took one and a half hours from when we got off plane to actually boarding the bus to hotel. One couple we met on holiday with 4 children waited two and a half hours! There was also no air conditioning which made the heat unbearable. On the way back our plane was delayed by over an hour due to the mismanagement of this airport. The pilot explained that we had missed our slot due to the cases being loaded too late and as we were already on the plane we just had to sit and wait. Our Tunisian friend said that the airport is always like this and that he has quite often complained. It is absolutely horrendous total unorganised chaos. p.s. Although the airport is clean the toilets are awful and when you come out someone is holding their hand out asking you for money for the pleasure of using the dirty toilet unbelievable.
This is a comparatively new airport in Tunisia and I have nothing but praise for it. It is clean smart and well organised. Check in and Security were quick and once through to airside a really good duty free shop and a bar. Great views from the glass fronted terminal although the view of some aircraft can be obscured by the piers. Everything ran smoothly and just a pleasure to travel through this airport.
Visited Uganda on 12/30/14 and departed on 01/09/15. Both arrival and departure experiences were smooth. Arrival hall is rather large. There is mandatory health screening before one can proceed to visa/passport control. Obtaining a visa is relatively easy. Present valid passport and make payment. Baggage claim appeared to be a rather large area with perhaps 2-3 carousels. At departure level the lighting seems rather deem. There is the mandatory screening of bags before you can enter and check in for the flight. The staff is very friendly. The facilities are clean and the departure hall appears small given the amenities (gift shops dining and duty free). The Karibuni Lounge is excellent. It puts to shame US airline lounges in the USA with its food offerings and amenities. Bathrooms are cleaned frequently by an attendant. Overall no issues with EBB airport. Immigration control staff are very friendly. The only drawback to this airport is that passengers have to be dropped off in the parking area and then make their way around the roadway to the departure level.
Entebbe airport sets good standards for an airport in Africa. Though I do not recommend staying in it for hours it is still a clean safe place. Coming from Sydney it is ok. Its clean and the lounge is amazing. Though having kids with me did make a hassle. Otherwise its a nice quiet airport to go to. Especially when the border security allowed me to go from the back to the front of the line. I like it.
The airport is old. Staff is friendly. The airport is no longer capable of dealing with the large numbers of traffic passing through.
Used Entebbe airport yesterday to fly to Dar-es-Salaam and was pleasantly surprised. Terminal is very small but clean staff are friendly and welcoming and the facilities are fine to while away a couple of hours. One of the best airports I've used in the East Africa region and wish all border control staff could be as pleasant!
I live in Kampala and fly in and out of this airport regularly. It is a rather small and quiet airport clean and modern after the refurbishment. There is not much to do a few duty free shops (overpriced) craft shops and a restaurant. Check-in area can be very crowded especially for BA KLM and Emirate flights. For all other international flights it is sufficient to arrive at the airport 1 hour before departure. The best this airport has to offer is probably the lounge. Clean extremely comfy sofas big TV screens friendly service hot showers internet access and an electronic massage chair.
Inbound they are now taking the passengers thru a temporary barrack on the side of the terminal. At the moment the arrival hall is being upgraded for CHOGM. Anyway it went quite smooth through immigration but the baggage area was very tiny for a A330 full of baggage. Departure was smooth. Remember that all of the airport is non-smoking. If you pass immigration there is really no way back. Lots of crafts to be bought if you have not bought enough already. One restaurant with a ok selection. Need new airconditioning.
Inbound: no problems quick and efficient. Outward bound: Spent an uncomfortable night in the public area on hard chairs and passed the time swatting mosquitos. Any air conditioning was made redundant by the doors being kept wide open. However check in was efficient and friendly. What a contrast when in the departure lounge. It was much cooler and refreshments were available with a reasonable variety on offer. General comment on the people and the country: wonderful.
Not much in terms of Air activity. Probably the best attention I have ever got from airport staff maybe because not so many people go through. Staff were genuinely friendly and willing to offer help. Apart from the local crafts there is not much to buy from the duty free that you wouldn't find at your average African airport. Only 2 terminals
Nice airport and not very busy. Staff were flexible and knew their job well. Business lounge is comfortable though the food is nothing exciting. Duty free options beat Nairobi but do not both if you are transiting through Europe or Dubai. Expect an hour drive to Kampala a fair bit more if you are hitting morning rush hour.
Small but very clean airport disembarking to exiting airport 20 -30 mins minimal duty free shops on arrival but more extensive on departure area. Very security conscious on entry and exit. All in all a walk in the park no hassle.
Arrived at 2040 on a Sat night along with 3 other flights and went into immigration hall only to find that whilst there were 8 booths only 2 of them were for EU passengers and the rest for Turks /Northern Cypriot people and as a result the queue was back to the door and then back out onto the apron area. Eventually an official told everyone to use all available booths but even then the immigration officials were extremely slow and scrutinised the passports to the point of overkill taking ages with each person. On return we had to go through two security screenings - why ? They told us that it was ok to take bottles of water through the second one. Also why are all the prices airside in Euros or nothing on them ? Surely a last chance to get rid of the Turkish lira.
Nice small airport easy to manage. Reminds me of Luton airport circa 1975. Very cheap duty free shops and security checks on entry to the terminal building as well as the normal checks going thru to airside which possibly only a small airport can deal with. But good security none the less.
It is clean quick and efficient passport control. Landed at 20.10 was driving off at 20.25! My return leg was the same 8 desks open for the 3 flights that were going to London around the same time with CTA. Very cheap cigarettes and alcohol airport staff are friendly and helpful. The chap that said announcements were not made in English is wrong - all flights are announced in Turkish and English. You can hardly miss your flight as there are only 6 gates! A small airport with only around 120 flights coming and going in one week but very efficient!
"A very clean airport but with often absent and very rude staff - a trait that we now know to be common in Turkey and Turkish Cyprus. There is a great lack of any English signage or translations of announcements. Hardly qualifies as an ""international"" airport on that score. On arrival we had no idea which of the bits of paper we had to fill in to avoid the stamp in our passports and on departure we sat ourselves by the gates and watched faces that we knew were to be on our flight so we wouldn't be likely to miss the plane. The duty free is very strange in Ercan - instead of a large shop selling everything there are loads of little shops all selling much the same thing. Despite Turkey and TRNC still having their own currency and being very keen to get their hands on Sterling and US Dollars the prices are all in Euros although mostly there are no prices on anything and you have to ask. This maked it very hard to compare between the various shops. And you also fall foul of a sneaky trick - you never get a price quoted in Turkish Lira - they tell you what it is in your own currency but what you don't realise is that they have converted it using the bank rate which is not at all favourable. Never use your credit card in Turkish Cyprus because they also charge extra and by the time you see the amount on your statement it's likely to be a fair bit more than you thought!! Having said that though if it's alcohol and tobacco you are after the prices are very cheap and even better than in the normal shops. One further warning - beware of the luggage trolleys!! They all work perfectly no wobbly wheels etc. but they give you an electric shock when you start moving them. Heaven knows what is in wheels or in the floor covering but I got a shock on arrival and again on departure. A fellow traveller told us that it happens a lot."
Very clean and security conscious - majority of staff willing to help unless they belong to Turkish Airlines . I found them to be most uncooperative lazy and downright rude to the point of looking at you when you ask a question and then turning around and walking away. So be warned - even the locals told me to watch out for this attitude and like a fool I walked straight into it.
Smart clean and modern north east of Leftkosa (Nicosia). Security conspicuous and efficient check in very efficient immigration slow (form filling !) Arrivals baggage collection was very slow and the baggage belt was to small for 220 passengers. The departure area has two cafes which take a variety of currencies and credit cards numerous small duty free shops (alcohol mainly) all keen for your custom. Walk to the planes - no buses. No complaints.
Very bad experience at this airport - stuck there for over 6 hours with no airport internet working and numerous flights delayed with large numbers of people wishing to get online. The airport seems to lack management and shows no interest in retaining the good will of customers - definitely will not be going back.
Visited Exeter Airport last week and was very impressed with the new Executive Lounge location with views across the runway more variety of food drink and work stations for the Business traveller. Altogether a very relaxing start to our holiday.
Airport fails to measure up. It is a great facility but when you get to the details it falls way short. Parking is a disaster and very expensive. The business lounge is ok (ish) but unless you have sixth sense and register before security you can't use it! If the airport is to cater for business passengers it will need to up its game.
I really dislike this airport. Ripping passengers off by charging them £1 for a plastic bag at security. At many other airports this is done at no extra charge. Parking is a shambles. Passenger areas are mediocre poorly heated overpriced - had no morning newspaper at 1100 in the morning.
Flew on 28th October day return from London City. Both arrivals and departures could do with a bit of modernisation however the staff were some of the friendliest I've encountered a real credit to the airport. Food and coffee in the restaurant in departures was very good. Boarding was well handled. A very positive pleasant experience.
Exeter Airport has a rather tired run down and disjointed feel. On arrival on FlyBe disembarkation was delayed for almost 20 minutes while passengers boarded an Air Europa 737 parked on the next stand. In the arrivals building the baggage belt was static and my case inaccessible without crawling along the belt to the hatch through which bags are placed on the carousel. There were no members of staff available to assist. On departing security was unbelievable slow and despite having allowed adequate time to clear security I had to be fast tracked to the head of the queue to avoid missing my departure.
There are even less holiday flights from Exeter this year than last and their cost is prohibitive. There is a lot of people in Devon who would love to fly locally as Bristol is not an option. Most of Bristol's holiday flights return in the early hours and after a long tiring day it is no joke having a 2 hour drive home from the airport. EasyJet have no plans to fly from Exeter as they say that their SW flights are OK from Bristol unfortunately they are the biggest middle of the night culprits. However they fly from Stansted and have still started to fly from Southend. May I suggest their reluctance is more to do with the exorbitant landing fees at Exeter. Lets get in a competent business man to pick Exeter up and turn it into the busy airport it could be as there is nothing wrong with the facilities just no flights!
We like Exeter airport as it is only around 1.5 hours drive away - small and civilised. The terminal facilities are fine except the toilets! They are disgustingly dirty - filthy toilets - walls and floors - it is evident that they are never cleaned properly. May I suggest that the airport manager looks at these facilities and speaks to the cleaning contractor (evidently a cheap contract) How does this look for uk cleanliness when visitors from other European countries depart/arrive from/at Exeter Airport!
Executive Lounge. Don't waste your money booking this. It is a small dingy room at the back of the departure lounge. No windows hot nothing to eat apart from flapjack and crisps and a bowl with six shrivelled oranges in!
I would like to give Exeter Airport a good revue as we use it at least once a year to go to The Canaries. It is a small provincial Airport with a relaxed atmosphere and very friendly staff! The small cafe offers good quality food and has a couple of bars. After collecting ones case there is a free drop off/pick up point and the main car park is only a 3 minute walk away or there is a free shuttle bus.
"What are the people in charge of Exeter airport thinking. The drop off and pick up facilities are non existent unless you count 10 minute free parking a bus ride away in car park 4 which is absolutely ridiculous. I had to pick up an elderly relative today. I could not go through to the old 20/10 minute parking area being confronted by a barrier. It was very poorly signed that I now needed to turn right into the adjacent car park and pay a £1 min for the pleasure so did a three point turn stopped and ran the forty yards to where I could see them waiting and hurried straight back to the car less than half a minute to be confronted by a parking assistant handing me what looked like a parking ticket. Whilst I fully understand the parking implications if they want to implement the parking restrictions and bylaws which apparently cover the area ""perhaps they could provide decent drop off and pick up facilities as used to exist in what used to be a convenient friendly little airport"". Unfortunately I will think twice about using this airport myself in the future until things change. Whilst I am on the subject of parking my visitors where shocked to see that their four days parking at Dublin airport at a cost of 19 Euros would have cost £56.20 in Exeter. I have used this airport many times in the past but will be loath to in the future with surcharges for local departure combined with high parking charges and limited destinations the trip to Bristol or Gatwick and its cheaper overall prices look more alluring."
The airport is well situated for access however the recent changes which mean you must pay to even drop off or collect are outrageous. Although the charge is small it is the principal of the matter that you are actually not using any facilities. The building has certainly outgrown the demand and requires carefully considered development.
Best plan I find at Exeter is not to go through to departures after checking in until the flight is called for boarding. It's so claustrophobic in departures with a feeble 'duty-free' shop
It's a great small airport but now outgrowing its terminal building. Given that more than one million people a year are using the airport there is an urgent need to build a larger building with superior and more varied shopping facilities to accommodate that extra trade. The terminal building at Guernsey airport is perhaps what Exeter should be aiming for.
Great regional airport small but perfectly packaged we left early on one of the first flights on a Saturday morning only problem check in started at 4:30am but security didn't open until 5am but concourse coffee bar was open. Once through security everything was open and adequate.
Having used the airport a few times this year I am impressed by the number of destinations that can be flown to from Exeter but the terminal is desperately small now for the number of passengers it handles. I was there on a saturday recently for a flight to Edinburgh and people were having to sit on the floor everywhere because of the sheer volume of passengers. I also find the shopping airside woefully inadequate and the fact the departure lounge has no windows whatsoever I find somewhat claustrophobic after a while. However if you fly on a quieter day it's a great place and so easy to get to and leave from and luggage is out in no time. Hopefully when the new terminal is built all these issues will be addressed.
Use this airport quite often. The building work in the check in area has been completed and it is now so much better lighter and more spacious. Some days have very busy periods ie Tuesday mornings when there are queues at the check in desks. The staff are pleasant helpful and usually very professional especially security who have a very difficult job to do both inside and outside the terminal. The airport is very well run and kept clean. Departure and arrivals areas both work well. New hangers for Flybe are advancing well (not funded by airport).
The airport is still having work carried out on it and it is a little difficult to comment. but it did what I wanted it to. although my main reservation was in the departure lounge is a room with no windows so once through customs you have no natural sunlight or viewing area until your flight is called.
Flew in on 28th march. Last time arrivals had renewal work in progress and a bit of a mess - however this time all the work seemed to be done and it was a pleasure to retrieve ones baggage speedily and be on my way. The departure check in is now in the act of being updated and was congested at the check in. In fact wife and myself were in the wrong queue as there were two queues and only on getiing up the line realised that the FLYBE people were in another line. Once through security again a big plus as they were very thorough - departure lounge modern and spacious. When completed this airport will be a good example of what a regional airport should be.
Plans to upgrade the terminal will be finalised once the airport has been sold to the private sector where funding is not so much of an issues. It is also worth noting that the new hangars are Flybe's and apart from sitting on airport land they are not being paid for by the airport.
Passed through EXT this past weekend for a flight to Belfast - given the amount of flights the airport is now handling especially during the summer season the passenger terminal is now too small & crowded for the number of passengers it's having to cope with. I'm aware there are plans to eventually build a new terminal but it seems the airport have opted to upgrade hanger facilities first - which from a passenger's point of view seems the wrong way around!
As airports go this one is nice a compact and has great road links with the rest of Devon and Cornwall. If you have a choice between Exeter Plymouth and Bristol my advice would be to choose Exeter Bristol may be bigger but the road to the airport is a real pain. Plymouth Airport is drab and tiny. Exeter is right on the A30 dual carriageway and the new departure lounge has made a real difference. Its great that the number of scheduled flights available from the airport are increasing too!
Fairly small newish airport with a few international but primarily domestic flights. I saw no options for dining outside of security and inside saw just two (a bar and a small cafe). There appeared to be just two rest rooms and one was not usable since there was an international flight arriving (I did not understand the connection). Taxis in Fairbanks are pricey (and there is a $1 per person surcharge after the first passenger)
Faleolo is the international airport for Samoa located 1 hour from Apia on Upolu island. A pain for late night/ early morning arrivals and departures but conveniently close to the ferries for Savaiii Apolima and Manono islands. Used Faleolo airport this last weekend as a business class passenger. First pax off the plane to a stretch limousine awaiting at bottom of steps! Together with police guard and band. 100% true but alas this VIP welcome was not for me but for the Samoan Head of State seated across from me on the plane. However no pomp and ceremony for me once inside this basic airport. Immigration was slow/methodical but courteous. Baggage claim and clearance even slower. On return check- in handled efficiently by Polynesian. No lounge facilities at Faleolo provided for premium passengers (only a govt lounge for VIPs). Landside toilets are derelict and filthy. Better to hold your water until you get airside. One rung above Port Moresby airport in PNG - which itself IS one big toilet. Immigration at APW outbound even slower than inbound due to a disorganised pax on an Air Pacific flight - also departing at 4.30am-5.00 am. Once airside an overpriced cafe and dutyfree but at least there's air-con. On the bright side this could be a really good airport with a just little attention to cleanliness from the Samoan Airport Authority (such a contrast to the country itself - Samoa is kept spick and span by its people). Note that you have to pay WST40 departure tax at ANZ/Westpac banks on departure (not incl in ticket).No big deal but for this amount of money (equiv USD 15-20) airport could at least keep the loos clean.
There have been a number of improvements at the Faleolo international airport but I still cannot get over how expensive duty free products are. I travel to and from Samoa at least three times a year and I have yet to purchase anything from duty free. It's just so much more cheaper at other international airports - even taking into consideration the rate of the Samoan tala in foreign countries! Airport taxes are just so ridiculously high it's unbelievable. Look at the departure tax for instance - I remember when they lifted the tax to $30 and justified it to the public by claiming that children under a certain age did not have to pay tax. My husband and I have two children - an eighteen year old and a 4year old we still have to pay $120 which calculates to 'more' - 'much more' than the four of us would have to pay to get out of Auckland International Airport (even taking into consideration the Samoan tala exchange rate!). And I need not elaborate on the many luxuries (100 times over) that are available at the Auckland international airport and NOT available at the Faleolo airport! Once the tax hits the $40 mark you might as well include it in the ticket like everyone else around the world whose departure tax is over $30! We pay tax on our tickets and at the airport ... why not just put them together and leave them on the ticket! That would be one huge improvement - and less hassle when flynig out of faleolo!
Apia's airport has been upgraded and presents a warm pacific feeling. The immigration/customs staff should be taught to smile though - especially after tourists are sold on the idea of a friendly pacific paradise proudly operated by the friendliest people on earth!
On arrival into APW in the evening heat arrived into immigration waiting for 5 minutes as there were no immigration officers to process our docs as if they were on lunch? This was a bit of a shock. Apart from that dilemma baggage was swift & on the conveyer belt pretty fast. Custom officers very polite & efficient. Faleolo airport is very open & spacious. In a hot humid climate tiles are laid through the entire airport. There are no main entrance doors to the terminal as it is one open place but very modern indeed. Departure lounge quite nice with the Tropical Pacific feel to it a big beautiful bar dominates the one huge departure lounge. This would be the only place together with the PH J Class lounge is air-conditioned.
"Arrivals at Faro are not too bad, queues at passport control manageable and baggage reclaim relatively quick. Obviously, as a holiday airport there are people milling around in arrivals looking for car rental and transfers but it all seems to work ok. Departing from Faro is a different story. Expect long, slow check in lines and repeat the experience at security. There's never any sign of anyone organising or controlling the system. Goodness knows what it's like in July and August. On my last visit, the Gents toilets stank, most of the soap dispensers at the sinks were empty, there were no paper towels to dry your hands and the hot air dryers didn't work. Food and drink (such as is available) is poor and ridiculously overpriced. There was litter everywhere. The whole place is a classic example of the ""if you don't like it you can stick it up your bum"" attitude that pervades so many airport operations. The Portuguese are wonderful, generous hospitable people. You'd not know it from travelling through Faro Airport"
Airport lounge at Faro was terrible 1 choice of awful sandwich and fruit salad. Debris all over as cleaner was sitting on chair making phone call. Actually left the lounge and bought a sandwich at subway. Complained there and complained back home to airport directly and Lounge Pass who we booked through. Both not interested. Do not pay to visit Faro lounge.
Just awful. Incredibly rude staff on the security at bag scan. Just making up rules for different passengers which were impossible to comply with on total power trip. Very upsetting. Awful experience.
The most awful airport I have ever had to use. No daylight. In front of security checkpoint there are bottles over bottles on the floor which are not removed. No free WiFi not even for 30 minutes as at most other airports. I carried by accident a pepper spray into plane and no one realized. Unfriendly staff. Half of the shops are closed or are being renovated. After baggage drop off you can't find anything to carry your heavy hand luggage. Waiting are at gate opens only 50 min before departure therefore you have to wait in the dark hall with no daylight. Dirty windows in waiting area A 52. Very dirty and disgusting toilets.
I just wanted to say a big thank you to all the way staff at Faro Airport who were not only a fantastic help but were also very friendly and were only to happy to take us in the wheelchairs to our flight area and they also took us on to the plane. This was our first time we had uses this service and were a little nervous thank you all again for all your help this made our trip a pleasure.
30th April 2014 arrived at Faro with 2 hours before take off. I fly to Faro 4/5 times a year and have never experienced such a stressful time as I did on 30th April. Easyjet bag drop off area was quick and efficient cannot say the same about customs. I was travelling with a friend and her 2 year old daughter we joined a queue and in total there must of been 300/400 people in queue's. We didn't move for the first half an hour more and more people were coming in but nowhere to go no one knew what the problem was and tempers were starting to rise including mine. It finally took 1 hour 15 mins to get through and even then I got stopped with the alarm going off and had a very unpleasant experience with the woman who was searching me and almost slapped her face. We then got in the passport queue and finally just made the flight by the skin of our teeth. I would love to know what the problem were and do not want to experience that day again ever stress levels were through the roof.
We were more then 2 hours early to the airport and still almost missed our plane. Checking in went very fast but we waited for over 1.5 hour for customs. There were about 300 people waiting in a very hot area. Customs changed the line constantly so people who came later were through customs earlier then others who waited for over 2 hours. People became very mad because they almost missed their plane. Customs did not seem to care. Staff were very slow. There are about 8 passages they used only 3. The shops behind customs did not have any customers because no passenger had the time. An awful experience. Customs should realise that if they continue this behaviour the economy of this area will suffer. I will never fly again from Faro.
Queues were unacceptable. Staff levels too low for amount of traffic. Airport not very modern it's dark gloomy and scruffy. The charge for soft drinks at their bar is ridiculous and the quality bad. Staff didn't care when complained.
In general the airport is not great but is what you would expect for a highly seasoned airport if you go there in the summer you will find rather huge queues staff are not the best but you will find very warm and nice people especially if they are younger. Food is overpriced but you can bring it yourself. It's a typical Low-cost airport so no surprise when you get there. The biggest problem in the airport are the passport control queues in the non-schegen are because many times 6 or 7 aircraft arrive at the same time so yo can expect to be at least half an hour in the queue. Other than that it's a rather normal airport.
Despite having a fairly 'modern' appearance the terminal is dark messy stuffy and dirty. On my last trip out I was once again confronted with extremely long lines at check in and security. Staff at check-in security and two retail outlets were very unfriendly even rude. I can not believe that no-one that works at this airport realizes that the service level of the staff has tremendous and negative impact on the perception of the travelers. I for sure think this is a terribly bad airport and I dread my travel through it every time I visit. Other negative experiences on this trip: misinformation on the flight information screens several menu items in the 'self service restaurant' not available (marked with a hand written sign: 'coming soon') and outrageously expensive toilets out of paper and non working vending machines at the gate. I get the impression that management of the airport is totally incompetent and un-caring. Faro Airport is as bad a promotion of the Algarve as it can get.
I might be very lucky however Faro Airport which I use regularly is fine. People who complain about the staff and queues might take a closer look at what staff are all too often forced to deal with. How many times does the clear message regarding what the arrangements are when passing through airport security? Liquids up to 100 ml are allowed provided they are placed in plastic bags. Simple? Not enough it would seem from the number of folk who seem astonished when given this information yet again on reaching the scanner point. No wonder the queues are sometimes longer than they need to be. The patience shown by airport staff should be the real talking point and not the perceived lack of speed when dealing with our aircraft security. Most travellers of course do anticipate the need to reach the scanner unencumbered by items that require to be placed separately and cannot be on ones person when scanners do their work. However Faro Airport has its fair share of individuals who exert a negative influence out of all proportion to their numbers on the experience of fellow passengers. So we should be encouraging them to take a little time to reach the point of entry ready to place the required items in the separate tray. Also of course ensuring that they have nothing on their person to inevitably trigger the alarm and unnecessarily placing yet more avoidable demands on airport personnel. Overall when passengers extend the courtesy of being prepared for their security arrangements things run more smoothly. This also applies to Duty Free shops when the need to produce boarding cards seems to present some travellers with astonishment to the extent that they then have to unearth the contents of at least one bag before being able to complete what should be a simple transaction. This all takes time of course and leads to frustration for staff and fellow passengers. Overall therefore before rushing to judge Faro Airport and its staff possibly based on a fleeting snapshot take time to reflect on the contribution that you and others have made to the experience.
This July will be my 7th year returning to the lovely Algarve. Last summer we travelled in July (kids school holidays) but previous to that it was always in June. Our experience last year was a complete nightmare. Like a previous post on this site the queues are everywhere and it creates panic with passengers afraid they will miss their flight. On arrival once we left our hired car we queued for the check-in desk - very long wait. Then once checked in we queued for the x-ray hand baggage check - very long wait. Then into the duty free lounge and we had to queue again for passport control. Terrified we would not make our flight. I can only assume the reason for this is peak time travel in July (as opposed to my previous years travelling in June) but now I see from other comments that this has happened on other months. I have to say it is the one thing that dampens my ideal holiday in Portugal - we are returning but I dread the thoughts of those long Queues. Surely they can incorporate passport control as you are going through baggage check x-rays?
Been a few years since I have been through Faro but must admit overall a good experience. Drop off system seems a bit confusing and security still slow but on the whole better than previous experiences.
The queues were made less bearable by jobs worth grumpy and disrespectful staff. Officials need to get a grip on the 30-45 min queues at peak time and use Easyjet's methodology of directing passengers to the next available assistant or security point. The staff badly need training. I'm sure there are good staff too but they need to get rid of the unhelpful and incompetent staff that are sending passengers home with sour tastes in their mouths and who may decide on another destination for their next holiday rather than face Faro airport again.
We use Faro airport very often. Checking in with bags is relatively acceptable although long queues. However after you have join the queue to pass through security. There the misery begins. There you see officials hanging around not working effectively when they could have opened more security gates. Every time we use Faro airport this is the part of the travel that really is the nasty aspect.
We have been using Faro airport for the last 20years. On arrival to pick up a pre booked hire car it was just a short walk through the doors to the right. When we arrived at the end of September 2012 there is now a ridiculous long walk down a tunnel to get to exactly the same place. This is made worse as some of the way is uphill. Not easy with cases those with mobility problems with children or elderly. We are hoping this is just temporary as it is an absolutely stupid thoughtless idea. I have said I would recommend this airport apart from the problem above which will make us think twice about returning.
Just arrived back from Faro airport this afternoon and I have to agree with the last review that this is the worst airport I have travelled through with a young family. We arrived 2.5 hours before our flight time and spent the next 2 hours queuing to get through to the departure gate. Checking our bags onto the flight was relatively quick and straightforward however once through this stage we had to join the queue to pass through security. We had to go back through the bag check in desk and join the end of the queue which by now stretched to the far end of the airport. Did not appear to be any rational process or system in place to try and move travellers efficiently through this aspect of your journey. This was causing distress to many who feared they would miss their flight. We eventually made it through this stage to the duty free area only to discover that any chance of visiting the shops was not an option as the you had to join another lengthy queue stretching the full span of the terminal to get through passport control and onto your departure gate. Not acceptable and quite frankly shambolic. Our holiday in Portugal was very good however this was a frustrating exasperating and disappointing end to the holiday and not a pleasant experience for anyone unfortunate enough to be passing through Faro today. Not sure if this is the norm and I would be shocked if this is how the authorities at Faro airport and the people in charge of tourism in Portugal wish to portray their airport.
I travelled through Faro airport with my wife and two young children. I have to say that it was one of the most inefficient airport that I have ever used for delays in getting through security. We waited in queue in the heat for 45 minutes. I can't imagine any variable reason for directing all travelling families with young kids and push chairs into one queue while all other 7 gates are free to use by everyone else many of which were completely free during our wait. This was a truly horrible and disappointing end to a lovely family holiday in Portugal.
Outrageous prices for drinks and food. The bar upstairs tried to charge me 12.5 Euro for a beer and a coke! When I said no way she lowered the price to 7.50 and said she had made a mistake! Really? Even at 7.5 Euro it was still outrageous. Duty free was poor too. The security and passport control with every booth at the automated booths working was fine. Staff in security were courteous too.
The food prices in this airport are outrageous. 12 Euro for a very poor burger meal is not acceptable - I tried to complain at the airport but no good - there is obviously no regulation of the commercial establishments operating here.
Faro airport is the gateway for a huge and lovely tourist destination the Algarve. I would like to share one thing with anyone using this airport. Do not use the ground floor catering establishments if you are on a budget. There is a lovely clean spacious canteen up on the first floor above the arrivals area. Unfortunately nothing similar in the departures area ! Go to the extreme end of the building (turn left on entering) and up the escalators or use the lift or stairs. The prices are reasonable for drinks and snacks. There are two areas you get a good view of the arrivals area from the open balcony bar area and of the baggage area from the rear canteen (when this is open). If you cannot find your tour rep when you arrive they are probably up there ! As regular users of this airport we have seen it at all times of the year and the summer season brings the usual pressures on all facilities from the sheer numbers of people that have to be processed. The toilets are clean the parking close by and a very reasonable cost and the local staff usually extremely helpful. It is one of the few airports I know that has functioning electronic passport readers but this has meant that the queues for the conventional desks can be excessively long and tiresome.
Nice airport prices not too much of a rip off. Check in desks an absolute nightmare. The straff seem to take a sadistic delight in slowing things down so much that enormous queues develop. We only just made it to the plane in time and had no time at all to look at the duty free area. We were warned that they were slow but were unprepared for the levels of deliberate obstructive incompetence. I had always thought that Manchester was bad but it is a model of efficiency now compared to Faro.
For those of you with children make sure you bring a packed lunch with you for them otherwise it could be a seriously expensive end to your holiday. 12 euros for a small burger meal is as close to extortion as I've ever seen! Other drinks and sandwiches are also seriously expensive and there's hardly any choice. What shops there are (no more than 4) are ok but there really is very little here. The airport itself is clean and tidy but that's not much help if you're stuck there for hours.
A nice little airport the check in and security was very quick and easy. However there is not enough option for shopping and the cafes and bars are extremely expensive. I had to pay 2.60 euros for a 330ml can of coke while a sandwich was even more! Good amount of seating by the gates is another plus while the views onto the airfield are wonderful.
A great little airport. My mid-July arrival on a Friday was simplicity itself. Travelling with only hand luggage passport control and customs was a breeze. Baggage hall looked quite busy . Had it not been for a second-rate local car hire company not cancelling my booking upon arrival I would have been out of the airport in ten minutes. Sadly had to use one of the major international firms at a far higher cost though the car and service was probably much better than I would otherwise have received. Upon departure if you only have hand luggage you just walk past the check-in queues straight to security. Very quiet on a Tuesday afternoon and staff were friendly and professional. Boarding gate was comfortable and plenty of seating although many people ignored the seating in favour of trying to jump the queue by hanging around the door. Fortunately they were ignored as gate staff applied Easyjet strict boarding procedure. Excellent shopping airside and plenty of refreshment options.
This is a pretty good airport with plenty of seats although I suspect in peak season it can get very crowded. A bit expensive - 1.80 euros for a small bottle of water and a very steep 3.50 euros for a 500ml bottle of coke!
Faro Airport is clean spacious and facilities are good. Check in and baggage reclaim are a doddle but it can get quite crowded in the peak season. The Winter is the best time to use this facility. Plenty of bars and eateries so a good transit point in general.
Our first time using Faro - arriving was fine it was a Monday and quiet. We were actually going to Isla Canela just over the border into Spain so got a good transfer coach at quite a cheap rate for the trip. Going home however was a different story it was a Friday and quite busy but there was only one person checking passports and the queue went for miles! Apart from that it all seemed OK as airports go.
Having not been to Portugal for 18 years until this summer I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of the place considering the number of passengers that it handles. Most of the flights are holiday charters of course but it is comfortable and provides what you need without any fuss.
Travelling on internal flights from Faro was a breeze. Check in was easy security swift easy to find the gate quick to load and baggage reclaim a breeze (15 minutes from plane door to exiting the terminal). My flight out of Faro was in the early morning so no shops were open and food outlets only just before the flight left however the lounge opens very early with a very good selection of drinks. Easy airport to navigate no real problems to moan about!
I've flown in and out of Faro around 50 times now. I think it is a superb airport. All the secuirtypassport etc well manned friendly and polite. The baggage reclaim is especially efficient. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes unlike BHX and LGW where I've had 40 minutes wait at the belt! The whole place is especially spacious. Catering is very good and very cheap. A couple of euros for ham and cheese croissant. Coffee is good and very cheap. The car parks are very close by and if you avoid the major car hire companies (who bus you in) you drop you car off within 100 metres of the departure desk. Overall never had a bad experience here. Which is more than I can say of UK airports.
Faro Airport is pretty good. Even in the busy season it copes but there are queues sometimes long at security and passport control during these busy times. I agree the catering is poor and costs an arm and a leg but hey isn't that last beer in the Algarve sunshine up on the roof terrace worth a couple of euros more? It certainly is to me!! Anyone who had experienced Faro Airport before it was rebuilt would think twice about decrying the place. That I can assure you was hell on earth.
Usual chaotic scenario during peak times with travel reps running here and there to assist . Some car hire depots require a short mini-bus ride but not a problem. Best tip is to save your leftover euros for the next trip and don't use them in the hideously expensive catering facilities. Overall cleanliness is good.
Seasonal Holiday Airport for Algarve region of Portugal. Pretty efficient and functional. My experience of Car Hire provision and location is good. Rental is next to Terminal Building and Car Return is on approach road with shuttle bus to the Terminal after drop off. Some facilities may be stretched in seasonal peak toilets/seating being two to mention. Shops are very expensive. Coke in Vending machine Eu2.45. Bag of sweets in paper shop Eu4.50. Faro Airport had large extension completed in 2003 Airbridges were added and new Check-in hall opened. Most airlines still park on the tarmac and your journey to the terminal is via a large shuttle bus. Only TAP and a limited number of other airlines use the Airbridge facilities. Overall: Clean efficient and a positive experience.
Very expensive refreshments (coffee pop sandwiches) and duty free items. Alcohol was cheaper in the city stores than at the duty free!
Allow an hour to check your car back as the lazy staff are not around to meet you and you get to wander around the spacious hot car park with your keys. On finding them they don't show ID so you could be giving the keys to anyone. The airport's fine small and laid-back. We didn't have time to see Faro thanks to this problem. It wouldn't kill anyone to have a mobile number for the rental car reps
Arriving was very easy less than 10 minutes from leaving the aircraft to standing at the bus stop. Departing was OK no queue for check-in (but I was lucky other airlines' desks seemed much busier) and security not too bad. There is a viewing area which had seats but nothing else it was quite relaxing there. The departures area was crowded and facilities rather limited. The bus link to the city was efficient it runs every half hour and took 15-20 minutes stopping outside the railway station. If you have a window seat on the city side during final approach the view is wonderful.
Was surprised that the only food option prior to clearing security check is the food vending machines. One is on the ground/parking level and the other machine area is in the observation area. I didn't realize that the guy wandering around the front of the security area is supposed to check your boarding pass in. His approach to the situation was rude but not rude enough to ruin the experience. Security is still sensitive about ceramic objects in carry-on/hand luggage. I had a small ceramic ornament that they found and examined. I was allowed to take it on with no further issues. Once I cleared the security area there was some nice shopping: clothing stores for men and women leather boutique and jewellery stores. The food area was on the level above the boarding gates. It was crowded but the staff was nice. The boarding area was crowded and there were not enough seats to wait so I ended up sitting on the ground. All in all the airport was okay but I prefer to fly in and out of Pisa instead.
By far the worst airport I have encountered. Very angry security. No customer service.
The car drop off area can only fit a few cars. After you enter the airport you have to take a small elevator upstairs to the check-in area. The check-in area is spacious. An agent told us to use a kiosk to print a boarding pass. But since our ticket was code shared with Lufthansa our reservation did not show up in the Lufthansa system. So we want back into line to check-in. There were only a few people in line. The Lufthansa web site for their commuter line (Cityhopper) said that only one carry-on was allowed (including a purse). But the agent let us take a rolling bag with a purse. They did weigh the rolling bag however the check-in was painless. We then went back downstairs to our gate.
Florence airport has recently moved the ground floor check-in desks to the first floor which is completely revamped. Some good leather seating is provided in nice airy surroundings. However the 3 check-in monitors are very small and concentrated along one small area thus meaning passengers must walk up to view them. The disadvantage of these monitors (at the time we were there) is they only show the major airlines desk numbers several scheduled flights remained without desk numbers including our Vueling flight. It was only when we asked an employee that we discovered the desks for our flight. Even after we had checked in no desk numbers were shown on the screens. Security was quick and trouble-free. Prices in the duty free area were just outrageous higher than in the city. Plenty of seating at the departure gates.
A compact and efficient airport but very with very unpleasant security. Was departing for Paris with a ceramic bowl in my hand luggage. Air France confirmed it was within weight and size limits to take onboard but very unpleasant security staff regarded it as a safety risk ('One could hit someone with it'). Had to make quite a scene (still embarrassed for it) to finally have the Security Officer to check with the AF pilot that did not think it was any security issue. Totally ridiculous argument from the Florence Security team claiming ceramic articles are forbidden in hand luggage everywhere but guess it also involved a certain degree of Italian pride.
Very small regional airport which is undergoing an expansion program so be prepared for building works. Check in chaotic no priority for frequent travellers. Limited amount of shops but well stocked. Our flight was delayed but ground staff did their best keeping us informed about the flight status.
A small airport with limited facilities but not unpleasant. The landside arrivals area is tiny and with shops just a couple of metres away from the barrier guarding the door from baggage reclaim it can get very congested. Baggage reclaim is reasonably swift. The departures area is adequate in size and our check-in experience has always been pretty efficient. The first floor duty-free shopping area has recently seen several new outlets opened and the selection of downstairs duty-free shops also seems to have improved over recent months - the shop selling sweaters and shirts is particularly reasonable price-wise although you have to buy a batch of shirts ('4 for 100 Euros') rather than individually. Airside snackbar reasonably priced with a good view over the apron. Gate areas are rather cramped but no more so than many regional airports. My wife and I have used the airport three times in the past year and the experience has always been fairly painless.
Aeroporto di Firenze is a very compact. The first thing you notice is how clean & bright it is. The airport has recently undergone a slight expansion. The original check in on the left-hand side has about 10 desks and there are a further 4/5 check in desks on the first floor. The cafés on the ground and first floor are reasonably priced clean and you get a good view of the airport & aircraft from the panoramic windows on the upper one. The departure lounge is fairly small but with plenty of seating. It is a very quiet unhurried environment - most pleasant. The only slight drawback is the TV monitors which show a very limited list of arrivals/departures. Also do be careful with the duty free shop on the first floor it's a very expensive with a small range of items. There is a much better one on the departure ground floor.
Flight delayed due to apparently strong cross winds. No information on TV screens about this - just a lot of talk and very upset passengers. Airport opened at 1830hours for flights so was able to catch my flight and only 1 hour late. Security a joke. Was travelling with a poster but had the poster container taken off me due to being on a London flight! Other people I was travelling with had posters and tube of the exact same size but they were allowed to go through without an problems. Florence is a small airport - don't expect much. They use buses to transport passengers from the terminal to the plane.
FLR is a very small airport- I believe the smallest I have ever been to. The LH check in was nice and relatively helpful especially as I had changed my ticket although they refused to check me in for my flight to O'hare. The bar was reasonably priced but a pain to use. The departures lounge was tiny with 5 gates for Schengen flights and one for International flights. They made us take a bus to the plane despite the fact that you could see it from the airport - it would have been quicker and better exercise to just walk to the plane. All in all an iffy airport.
"Amerigo Vespucci airport (FLR) is an inadequate facility. The first thing you'll notice about this airport is the landing. The runway(s) is short and a steep hill to the north of it greatly influences air traffic. Every time the wind allows it runway 5 is used for landing but when runway 23 is used the approach is complicated and forces a tight base leg (to avoid the hill): plenty of ""go arounds"" occur. The preferred takeoff runway is 23. The main problem though is the inadequacy of taxiways: no taxiway is present on the northern end of the runway (23 side) so all plains landing on 5 and taking off on 23 are forced to reach the distant end and perform a ""backtrack"". As a consequence aircraft take a long time to clear the runway after landing on 5; and have to occupy the runway for a while on takeoff from 23. At peak hours this is a cause for delays. The terminals (departure and arrivals) are both small. Most flights are bound to and from major European hubs for connections (CDG FRA MUC BRU) and tend to all leave and arrive at the same time. The terminals are therefore often crowded and inadequate. Little shopping can be done the only food you can get is a very expensive bar in the departure terminal (2nd floor) and a lousy restaurant in the arrivals terminal. Because most flights are connecting from hubs luggage loss is a common case: the Lost Luggage Service Window is understaffed. Expect delays. Customs aren't a major issue. A pair of police officers stand at the exit from the baggage claim area and stop passengers arriving from outside the EU (identified by the luggage slip). Those passangers have already cleared customs at the European hub they have connected in and these officers only ask for things to declare. They rarely ask/want anything beyond that."
Forlì airport is very small. The service before leave and after the arriving is very good and friendly. The location is good also because is possible to join city like Rimini Bologna and Ravenna in a very few time. Quite good the service for the disable people.
This airport is so small! First time I flew into It I came off the Plane and was out into the car park in around 1 minute 30 seconds! (only hand luggage with me). This airport is quite a way from Bologna so you need to catch a Taxi to the station in the town for around 12 Euros. Coming back the airport has a couple of nice bars and a cafe. The Taxi driver from Forli railway station to the airport was very friendly. Forli itself is very 60's Italian - don't expect any real culture.
"Terminal H is horrible. Very little food selection. Once through security there is only access to minimal facilities. Only a few outlets for charging phones - many don't work! Generally, too many passengers and too busy in the terminal."
We flew with Air Canada to Ottawa. There is no Lounge access for Status Customer and/or BC Traveler. Departure was on time. Boarding were earlier than announced. Security check was fast but unfriendly.
Worst airport I've traveled to. Customs is a joke especially if you are trying to catch a connecting flight. They don't care if you are going to miss your flight and have no respect towards customers. I have never seen such an unorganized international airport. I will be avoiding this airport at all costs. Spend a little more money and do what you can to avoid this stress.
"Having travelled the world this is one of the worst airports I've had the unfortunate pleasure to experience. Third world countries have more organized and passenger friendly airports than FLL. Not one employee seems to be engaged in their job and there is terrible to no choice to find something to eat. The restaurant staff do not offer a smile let alone ""please come and spend money with us"" and there was even an employee in uniform sleeping on one of the seats at a gate. Get your act together Ft Lauderdale your airport is an embarrassment."
Worst experience ever for going through customs at Ft Lauderdale airport. They treat passengers horribly. Won't travel internationally through this airport ever again.
Of all the airports I've been to both domestic and internationally FLL ranks at the bottom of the list. While I had no problems getting in or out processing through security or boarding or de-boarding the plane it is the airport itself which has no personality or amenities for passengers. For someone with a few hours to kill you need more than two massive overly crowded food courts. Here all they offer are two food and drink areas both massively packed. I was relegated to five chicken strips and a domestic beer standing up while eating (no where to sit) for about $15. Most airports have many different areas like several basic food areas more upscale options and several more sports pub/bar areas. Not here it is all thrown into one area with confusing cafeteria style lines and nowhere to sit. I would avoid this airport at all costs. My home airport LAX is a joke but seems like a luxury compared to this place.
Flew into terminal 3 with a five hour layover. The only food option in terminal 3 is cuban food. The coffee is awful. Bought the caprese sandwiches at the deli. They were $11 and were soggy. We pulled out the low quality meat and ended up throwing away most of it. No way to go to another terminal for more options. Very disappointing.
Unfortunately I was very disappointed in this airport. For all the traffic they get from cruise ships they should have plenty of money to expand. They need to be triple the size! Long long check-in lines escalator not working long lines to elevator. In line for security screen were told that only flights leaving in the next 2.5 hours could be admitted though. People were waiting everywhere. Upgrade upgrade. I'll avoid this airport at all costs.
Arriving at FLL Airport was definitely awful. When the airplane landed we had to wait approx 20 min for the stairs to arrive. There were long queues at immigration and customs. For foreigners this is airport should be avoided by all means. Our baggage was open for check and verification and that was not a good experience at all but we had no choice other than co-operating.
Avoid this airport at all costs. FLL is too small to handle their volume of passengers. They cannot handle their international passenger load nor the load imposed by multiple cruise ship arrivals at Port Everglades. There aren't enough baggage agents nor TSA security agents and lines to handle the large crowds. Go to MIA instead. You will be much happier.
I can only add to the other reviews about international arrivals. Fort Lauderdale airport and county are doing more harm than good accepting these international flights. The airport and staff are not equipped trained or motivated to handle the situation. Build what is needed then accept the flights. I was lucky having global entry I cannot imagine if you had kids etc. I travel all over and this is beyond 3rd world experience. The so a called 3rd world is far superior and they welcome foreign tourist with open arms. Fort Lauderdale is scaring tourists away.
This airport is not yet set up to handle large flights and certainly not more than one at any time. They use buses to transport you from the plane to terminal which means de-planing takes a long time. Then you queue for hours to get through the different stages - it seemed like staff were almost creating the chaos by poor judgements and there were just not enough people available to handle the volumes in immigration. Many conversations heard about how it was intentionally bad because they didn't want the cheap airlines but I was horrified by the number of travellers saying they would not come to Florida again - having tried both MIA and FLL and found both to be terribly organised. They should try LAX perhaps for a real chaos but this is terrible for the travel industry and Norwegian who are currently offering good value flights.
Flying in and out of Terminal 3 last week I found this airport acceptable if nothing special. On arrival our luggage took a while to arrive. On departure check-in was fast and efficient - so was security which also managed to be friendly (so rare these days!). Post-security the amenities are adequate though some of the magazines in the newsstand were out of date. In previous visits I'd found the bar next to gates 9 and 10 quite friendly and was happy to see that it remains so.
I think this Airport would be a brilliant set for Victor in 'One Foot in the Grave' I in fact found myself saying over and over again 'I don't believe it' and I didn't as this was the worst experience I have ever had. The USA have really got it so wrong what a disorganised mess. Please try to avoid this airport it is awful. You go from one unnecessary queue to another. USA you really need to address this you are in the 21st Century we all expect more no not more queuing not more security checks not more cops more service a brighter and better airport where a human can breath.
After a long 8+ hours flight from London when you are feeling tired and drained of all energy late at night the last thing you would want is to have a really bad airport experience. We had to stay on the plane for 1 hour doing nothing as customs was full up and there were no stairs available. When the stairs did finally arrive it took ages to get out of the plane as there were building works going on in T4 so we had to get shuttle buses to a different terminal. These buses were good (very cold) and the staff were quite nice but then a dreadful thing happened as we neared the other terminal. The fire alarm went off! At 10pm when the kids are really tired that's the last thing you need. Hundreds of people had to evacuate the building and were standing around in random places outside. We waited in the shuttle bus for 1 hour+ so by the time we had the all clear (after the fire dept. checked the building and everyone got put back into the correct place we got into customs. A 3 hour queue at 10pm. Surely it would be a quieter time than normal? But no. The cabin crew went first then the old ladies in wheelchairs then disabled people and then us (we don't have US passports so we couldn't use the automatic kiosks). We waited and waited and waited until finally the slightly snappy customs officer got us all fingerprinted and checked. The staff were nice enough but it was extremely exhausting (we couldn't use electronics in the customs area) and it was hot and there was no water being offered or water machines/vending machines to be seen. After the long wait one of the baggage handlers had the bags ready for us. We got out of the old smelly terminal and entered an abyss of people smoking/shouting loads of cars traffic jams and beeping horns. We got to the bus stop to the off site rental car centre and then our holiday really began.
After a superb but long 9 hr flight from UK with Norwegian we were held on the aircraft 2 hrs before piling into immigration for another 2 glorious hours this airport clearly cant cope and shouldn't give the airlines slots if they are unable to service the passengers terrible blot on the US at the start of what's going to be a great holiday. We were on time and nobody seemed to know what was happening and how they were going get everybody in when its so late at night and everybody is tired this is no way to treat customers. And when we finally got through to pick the bags up there was another queue waiting for us and asking exactly the same questions the last official asked he even had the audacity when we said we were here for 14 days to say well 13 now.
The airport is small in size and a real mess. I have never experienced such long waiting times in immigration at any airport in the US or abroad. If you are not a US citizen you will have to wait for more than two hours just in the immigration line and you just can't do anything while you are standing there except staring at fellow passengers. Use of any electronic items like cell-phones or tablets is prohibited in that area. Remember this happens after you are completely drained of all energy by traveling for 6 plus hours on an international flight. Even after collecting bags it took me more than 20 min in line to get out of customs area. The only good thing I found was shorter security lines in terminal 3 but may be I was just lucky to go in at a slow time. There are no decent quality restaurants in terminal 3. The seating areas are okay. There is construction going on everywhere and the toilets are dirty.
This is the worst airport I have traveled through. Arrived on-time from an international flight and sat on the plane for 2 hours because immigrations/customs was full. Then stood in another 1 hour line trying to get through customs and thankfully I skipped a huge line because I have an American passport. The international line looked awful they had to pass out water to people because they had been waiting for so long. Took me 4 hours to get through it all so obviously I missed my connection (as did the whole airport). It was a Wednesday night not exactly a crazy time to travel. The people working at the airline counter said this happens every night because immigrations/customs is so slow/small and too many planes come in.
Breeze in breeze out..........Right. It took 5 hours to clear international arrivals including sitting on the plane for an hour and a half as the immigration area could not hold anymore people. This has been and ongoing problem since the beginning of the year and is getting progressively worst. There appears to be nothing in place to address this problem and definitely does not leave a good impression for first time visitors to the country.
Switching from F to E concourse was a mess. There are no clear signs as to where to go and a large group ended up outside and having to go through security again. This is not acceptable. The airport management needs to have enough signs to get passengers from one concourse to the other. So disappointing!
"Disorganized mess. Security area is a free for all. Customs area if better organized and properly manned may one day reach the status of disorganized mess. No help from airline staff (Spirit) regarding luggage and connections. The US custom service was too busy helping foreign nationals make their connections which left them unable to help people with US passports. Yelling screaming and lines that not even Disneyworld has seen. Brush up on your Spanish (its the language spoken). Asked a custom worker if this situation was unusual. ""It's an everyday thing here""."
Arrived and departed through Terminal 2 earlier this month. Terminal 2 is small but it has a nice compact design so you don't have to walk miles to get to anything. Food options are limited but we were satisfied with what we had. Check in and security were both efficient polite and professional. It could use more seating but what Terminal couldn't? We were fortunate to be there during non-peak times so there was no problem finding seating in the food area and again near our gate.
Fly out of somewhere else if possible. I live in Jacksonville FL and took a recent trip to Costa Rica. It was much cheaper to fly out of this airport and did not have to switch planes. So I drove 5 hours. On departure the airport is old and overcrowded not enough seats in the terminal. The airline was late arriving which made things worse. However this was nothing. Upon arrival on a Saturday at 12.30 pm from Costa Rica the real fun starts. After debarkation we waited about 20 minutes to go through a self serve customs kiosk which scans your passport and takes your photo then another 20 min having a live custom agent do the same thing ok so still not too bad then down to baggage bags arrived quick then after getting your bag you have to again go through customs and have your passport checked even though you have done this twice already. This line of several hundred people was wrapped all around baggage claim. They do not look through your bags just checking your passport for the third time it makes no sense oh and there is an airport employee running around telling you not to use your cell phones in baggage claim or 500$ fine.
Worst airport experience in my 20 years of flying. Spirit Airlines particularly did a terrible job. The security line was out the door and wrapped around down the sidewalk. The employee's were rude and unhelpful. Sprit Airlines did not announce the boarding process it was a free for all and I paid extra to be boarded first in zone 1. I will never fly Spirit airlines to Ft. Lauderdale again.
This is probably not the worst airport in North America but I haven't visited them all so the jury is out. Terminal 2 is a disorganized mess for passengers. Check-in can't be accomplished more than a couple of hours before flight time and you sit with your baggage in the few seats available in the vicinity of a donut shop. After finally checking in along with huge crowds you shuffle through a convoluted security system and finally reach a cramped waiting room that's about one-third of the size it needs to be populated by a bar/restaurant and another eatery neither of which is in any danger of approaching culinary adequacy. Through it all the people on staff are very friendly though how they can maintain that attitude working in such a dump is beyond me. However they really should be commended.
Security was a nightmare. Queue went outdoors. No electrical for charging electronics. February 21 2014.
"I had a bad experience at the Fort Lauderdale airport (in the US Air terminal E) this morning. It would be nice to be treated nicely at their shops. At one shop I purchased something and because there was no register display and because the shop employee mumbled I asked her to repeat the price. She did but in a very rude tone of voice. Similarly I went to ""Key West Coffee"" to get a cup of coffee and the employee did not say a word to me. When I told her the coffee run was empty she also didn't utter a word. It would be nice to be treated with a slight bit of respect. Just leaves a bad taste in my mouth about the Lauderdale airport and in particular the US Airways wing."
"It was cheaper to fly here than Miami so I chose it. Leaving after arriving was easy. The ""in terminal"" car rentals are all actually a bus ride away. I should have chosen the off site cheaper rental which would have been the same hassle to get to. The return was when I noticed how much I don't like the airport. There is the car rental return and then bus ride to the terminals. They are not interconnected. This was a problem for the club. I arrived far too early (to account for the car return) and expected to spend my time in the UA club however my flight was out of a terminal with no clubs and it is not possible to go to another terminal since you're only allowed in with a flight coupon for that terminal. I ended up waiting 3+ hours in a crowded loud old airport with minimal to no amenities. The bathrooms are tiny with lines there is one small bar/restaurant with only self service and mostly stand up tables. There are some snack vendors. There are not enough outlets for all that need to plug in. I would go to Miami next time even if my destination was closer to FLL. I am glad to see they are renovating and remodelling the airport. Perhaps that will help."
This airport is dirty over crowded. The biggest problem to me was the total absence of family bathrooms after we went through security. We had a long wait as we had left a cruise ship. I travel in a wheelchair and sometimes need help in the restroom if the floor is wet or it is poorly arranged. Luckily a nice traveler overheard my husband ask for a female staff to help me and she offered to go with me with the staff person never showed up. Many people were in this airport in wheelchairs or with small children. There is remodelling in process so hopefully this problem is being addressed.
This airport needs a lot of upgrades. I flew here from Houston in the summer of 2012 on United and was disappointed. We came 2 hours before our flight and ended up sitting for 1.5 hours in the dull cramped up concourse with absolutely nothing to do. There is about 4 food options in the concourse in terminal 1. I would not recommend this airport for many reasons. It is very dull and crowded with nothing to do.
This international airport is growing fast and is very crowded and under construction. The lines at US customs are very long. Our party had 1.5 hrs to make a 7.05 am. connection but missed it due to the slow customs process which had only 3 officers for US citizens. One other employee seemed to enjoy telling passengers who asked if anything could be done to help them make their connections 'Probably not'. Finally he called out 2 or 3 connecting flights but only a handful got to the front of the line. The current state of affairs makes a strong case for an upgrade to Global Entry expedited clearance. If you don't travel often enough to justify the premium avoid this point of entry.
"Spirit gates are old dirty congested and lack any comfort. Customs/immigration is a ""keystone cop"" operation. Security is cramped outdated and lacks customer service."
I've never been in such a dirty airport with very little facilities. The air was thick and things didn't seem to circulate properly. The ceilings are very low for a place where hundreds of people are breathing walking and causing friction in the pathways. The gate we stayed at had minimal facilities between convenient store/food areas. I would absolutely not recommend this for transit and am actually recommending people not to go here if they can help it.
I have traveled all over the world and come into the US in almost every entry point and never have I had to wait over 2 hours to go though customs. What an embarrassment that they can not get US citizens in to their own country with competence. The line for visitors was less than an hour. There we're children screaming and crying. Not a single announcement about delays or the time it was taking.
Terminal 3 arrival and departure. Easy enough to get to consolidated car rental facility. Easy return as well as well marked for each car company. Security a breeze (late afternoon departure) with many open lanes. Be warned there is little in the concourse (US Air/American) so bring anything you need. Seating areas were fine but limited eating and areas with snacks and only 1 bathroom for the entire concourse.
Arrival is painless but departing is the complete opposite. Very cramped check-in area and security is an absolute disaster. If you arrive before 10.00 am they only have two security desks open despite the hundreds of people lined up to get to their departure gates. Air side there are very few amenities. Overall not a great experience.
Though FLL provides an easier outlet for Miami traffic this airport could use some improvement. Firstly the gate areas are slightly unkempt and rather cramped for the amount of people who travel through here. The shops are unspectacular and there aren't that many of them. Security took far longer than it needed too and I found the procedure uncomfortable (I prefer the conventional box method). Next time I'm flying into MIA even if it's seemingly worse.
FLL provides a much more efficient easier and mostly cheaper alternative to Miami International. Signage to/from the airport is very good the terminal (while quite busy) is much easier to navigate than MIA and the rental car facility is a short walk across the terminal by covered walkway. Dining and business facilities in Terminal 1 are very basic but adequate. The terminal wasn't the cleanest but no worse than most U.S. airports. The TSA checkpoint moved very quickly considering it was a holiday weekend.
Vancouver to Guangzhou connected to Nepal. Very clean and very large. We arrived for a 2 hr layover and then connected to another international flight. Had to go thru security get photographed and passport stamped before re-entering the departure level. Also had to go thru security frisk and handbag xray. The xray person was very angry at everyone and all she did was yell and scream in Chinese. No one had an idea what was going on. The other staff member tried in broken english to help passengers run the gauntlet of this abusive female. When we returned we ran thru the same procedure except the staff was nice. As a matter of fact I left my wallet and the xray machine and the 2 staff members tracked me down in the airport and returned it. Talk about excellent service. Well done Guangzhou!
One of the worst airports I've experienced. The staff have poor English skills. The airport is disorganized. The queues at security check were extremely long and I spent 1 hour there at customs and that was enough for me in Guangzhou Airport.
Sydney to Manchester. The flight was via Beijing and Amsterdam. When the flight arrived an official pointed my self and several other passengers to a corner took our passports and motioned for us to stay there. We were quite worried and had no idea what was happening. 15 minutes later he came back with stamped passports and pointed us towards some steps. With difficulty we worked out which direction we were supposed to be heading. On the way back a similar situation took place. This time about a dozen of us has about an hour to get from one plane to another our passports were taken and only at this point were boarding passes issued. One lady was arguing with the airport attendant who had taken her passport then lost it. It took several other passengers to point out that she had taken the ladies passport. After running to get to the plane going to Australia it set off 30 mins late due to other passenger not being able to get there on time. I will never take this route again.
Paris to Hanoi via Guangzhou return a 16 hr transit time on the way in and 8 hrs on the return. The transit area is small albeit rich in hard seats. No room to relax and sleep. Shops overpriced no books in English available restaurants overpriced security staff particularly rude and impolite the boarding calls are loud and attacked my nerves. There was no available free drinking water on the way back. I managed to place a call to Vietnam using my French Visa card - I was charged EUR 42 for 1minute. Yes 42 EUR. I will never again travel via Guangzhou - no sense of customer relationship customer management and comfort facilities.
Was curious what CAN would be like before I flew there. The airport was humid and the air conditioning system was not turned on when I arrived at 5am. Eventually it was turned on when the crowds started coming in around 7am. I was transferring through the airport and I did not have to queue for more than 2 mins at any counter. It is a very large terminal and I could see janitors cleaning the area from time to time. The smoking areas were located downstairs along with the lavatories too but I managed to spot another lavatory on the same floor as the departures. A lot of seats were allocated in the waiting area and I found a corner to sit and rest for 8hrs waiting for my next flight. China Southern has really applaudable transfer staff. Avoid the over priced shops and restaurants in the departure hall.
One of the worst airports I've seen. Untidy bad service and very unorganised. When the queues at customs were really long they only opened 2 counters one for Business and First Class and the other for the rest. When I arrived there in July it was around 40 degrees and they didn't turn on the air con. Staff had terrible English and foreign language skills. Check in counters are terrible - passengers to 5 different destinations checked in at the same counters. When I was at customs here there was only 5 mins till the plane was scheduled to take off and I asked the staff politely if I could go to the front they said no. Flying there is cheaper than HKIA so cheap service is what you get from cheap airports.
Similar experience when arriving during December. Total disorganisation meets you upon arrival - the Chinese have no concept of Transit Passengers so everyone has to Book Out and then Book In! China Southern staff then brought Passports and Boarding Cards for the onward journey to Manila - they did not speak English and it took 10 minutes to distribute three Passports.
It's freezing baffling and poorly organized. Even the color scheme evokes misery. We had the misfortune to have two 5 hour layovers there in the course of a week. Both were awful experiences. The ridiculous way they handle transfers - taking your passports and then waving them around to a large group of people is strange. Then you go through additional security where they are sure to confiscate things that got through your departure airport fine. In the terminal the selection of restaurants is very poor. Each was overpriced and the food was awful. One of the restaurants offers a plate of pringles for ten dollars. The stores are strange - I bought a bottle of water at the same store during each layover. That same bottle of water cost me a different amount each time. The price they charged my boyfriend for a can of beer was in two currencies - they wanted two dollars and two yuan. I'm pretty sure they were just arbitrarily choosing prices. The place was the bleakest airport I've ever been in and I never want to go back.
If you fly into CAN during the winter bring plenty of extra clothing. No heat. It is the largest most disorganized coldest airport I have ever entered and departed. International to domestic or domestic to international is the worst I have ever seen. But the schedule of flights is great. You can get to any where in the world form CAN so I guess you cannot have the best of two worlds. Just prepare to be cold during the winter.
Looks like an impressive building but with some problems. Transiting was a hassle as mentioned by others before. There are long queues at security and probably due to Asian Games they will frisk everyone. The worst part is the smoking areas at the international departure are a serious design flaw. There is no separate room with proper separate ventilation system. The smoking areas are just designated corners right next to the washrooms nursing rooms and drinking water! Worse there is one smoking area for every two boarding gates. All the international holding areas for the boarding gates are filled with putrid smoke. While my family with children were waiting there for 4 hours waiting in transit we had to escape to somewhere near the immigration counter further away from the boarding gates. Anyone coming to Guangzhou who doesn't want to inhale second hand smoke please bring a gas mask.
We passed through CAN as transit passengers. We missed our connecting flight because there was no one at the transfer desk for China Southern Airlines for a good half-hour after we arrived causing us to miss our flight. We were rebooked on a flight several hours later giving as ample time to enjoy the departure area. Transfers at this airport even between international flights require passing through immigration and the process seems fairly disorganized. Someone takes your passport you wait and wait and wait not knowing what's going on. Eventually you are escorted to the departures area where you have to pass through another security checkpoint. When we were there security staff were not allowing transit passengers to take through bottles purchased in the duty-free areas of their initial departure airports which caused considerable argument from passengers. Once through security the departures area is spacious and clean enough. There is no airport-wide wi-fi although one can surreptitiously find a connection and log on if standing close enough to one of the airport lounges. There are a number of the standard kinds of duty-free liquor tobacco and luxury goods shops and several souvenir shops. The one bookstore has books and magazines only in Chinese. There are some restaurants/snack bars with comfortable chairs and good views of the tarmac and planes and staff don't seem to mind if you camp out there for awhile if you order something. Food prices are probably high for China but didn't seem outrageous. Still given the badly organized transit procedures and in our case apparent lack of concern for customer service from airline staff. this airport is best avoided if you're only transiting through it.
New metro service to the airport is filled to crush levels not ideal for travellers. Flying to Brisbane but it was written as Bu Li Si Ban on screens causing much confusion. Food was ridiculously expensive with an apple juice in a small high ball glass costing almost AU$10 or 58CNY. Outside the airport would only be 5 or 6CNY. Security was very tight due to Asian Games being held in GZ. There is a golf cart taxi service too to get from one side of the airport to another due to the expansive size of the place.
I found the check-in system confusing to say the least. Eventually I saw a small line with mixed nationalities and decided this mist be the Thai flight to Bangkok. I was right. But there was no signage to indicate this. just a blank screen. And on the departure floor there was only one money change. Despite several flights a day to Bangkok they dont change baht. They couldnt even tell me what the exchange rate was. But they would give me US$$. I decided to take a chance and change it in Bangkok. Smart move as it turned out as there is no commission fee. If looking for somewhere to eat go down to the floor between departures and arrivals. A quick example - a capuccino down there was 32 CNY and on the departures floor 65 CNY. And its the latter price if you wait until after clearing immigration. The customs line on arrival hasn't changed from a previous comment.
We were transit from Bangkok to Hong Kong through Guangzhou. Be very aware when transiting in CAN! Upon approaching customs you inform the agent that you are transit passengers. He or she will not stamp your passport but then will take the passport and boarding pass for the continuing flight and give it to a man in uniform who stuffs it into his back pocket and orders you to stand in an area six feet from customs with the other transit folks. After gathering three or four passports this uniformed character runs off to an office. I observed this occurring for five or six additional passengers. Then after about twenty minutes a young lady in uniform returns with a stack of ten or twelve passports - you must follow her around and point our your passport with she finally gives back to you. The boarding pass has a bunch of new stamps on it and you are led through a gate (with this group of unrelated transit passengers) and through a new security point and back into the gate area. A very intimidating and sloppy process - would not recommend that anyone ever transit through CAN. Later we found the terminal dirty and cold expensive and most employees were useless in explaining our six our delay in the continuing forty minute flight to HKG.
Modern and clean. Clearing customs was slow and frustrating due to only one line being available for foreigners despite other custom officers having nothing to do. Received bags around 35 min after leaving the aircraft which is a little slow. Finding the check in desk for a connecting domestic flight was difficult due to a lack of signage and airport staff sending me the wrong direction despite showing my ticket. Was stopped by an english speaking man pretending to be airport staff and asking for my ticket and money caution advised. Airport has many restaurants shops and money exchangers. My general impression was good but it can be a little difficult for the first time visitor.
Very new airport and far better than the old Guangzhou airport BUT - I have passed through this airport three times once missing my plane and twice nearly missing my plane. Reasons are the amazing queues everywhere from the check in to (especially) the security control. I do not understand why this has to be so much less efficient than Shanghai or Beijing? Last time I came at 6:30 for an 8:25 plane (domestic flight to Shanghai) and reached it just in the nick of time. Therefore be early. Apart from that though nice and spacious the lousy quality is giving it away: Leaky roof piping atrocious toilets with broken local electronic equipment. No international newspapers etc. despite being an international airport. And the walkways are dominated by these battery driven transportation cars for passengers which are outright dangerous due to sheer speed. In other places such cars are for the disabled here they seem to be only for the lazy ones.
The airport inside is magnificent spacious and even the air conditioning was just right for subtropical weather in Guangzhou. The staff were courteous and offered my relatives where to check in for China Southern flight to Tokyo Narita. Everything such as foreign exchange food duty free shopping all organized into the hallway before customs making it easy to find.
It's a good airport and compared to most other airports the luggage handling is very fast and efficient. To the downside is that food and beverage prices are very high. When travelling from and to the airport I would suggest everyone to just take a coach to your hotel instead of a taxi. Inside GZ the taxi service is reliable but from the airport taxi driver try to take advantage of people who don't know. The bus service to for example the garden hotel just cost 17rmb per person.
Used Baiyun Airport 4 times in the past 2 months. Found both Domestic and International Departures well-run and efficient
Flew from new Guangzhou Bayon to Ho Chi Minh City. Be prepared for delays going through security screening. With the new airport it appears they have hired a lot of new security screeners. While professional and unfailingly polite they lack experience. As such they do not recognize as safe such many harmless metal items as nail clippers tweezers (or in my casea cheap sewing kit scissors with a one-inch blade). As a result be prepared for delays - perhaps lengthy - while they spend a lot of time searching your bag (or that of the person ahead of you!) and examining these items which they then decide are harmless.
Negative sides: It's a rather new airport but due to bad maintenance some parts already seem old. For example the few gates that are on the lower ground (at least in the A section) or the toilets which can sometimes be very dirty. The biggest problem to me is smoke: people smoke in the toilets although it's forbidden and the smoking areas are too close to areas you want to go to. For example you'll have to stand in front of the open door of the smoking room to get water from the dispenser. Positive sides: check-in and security usually fast and baggage claim the most efficient I know. First time I landed in Guangzhou (from a domestic flight so no immigration or check whatsoever) my luggage was already going out the trail by the time I arrived!
"While clean and shiny and generally an OK airport the international to China domestic transfer desk remains an understaffed nightmare. At least no one tried to extort a preposterous excess baggage fee from us on this trip. If you are coming in to China from abroad try and make your transfer in Hong Kong so you fly to your destination on an ""international"" flight."
Guangzhou Airport flew out of for the first time back to Helsinki instead of using Hong Kong. Smart and spacious and well organized as are most of the newer airports in China these days sadly puts a lot of the main European and more so the American airports to shame. Sign posts and directions are clearly visible in English so getting around is not a problem. From checking into passing through security the process was fairly slick with no noticeable delays some of the gates at the end of the piers are a good walk but a moving walkway covers most of the distance assistance by way of golf carts are available. Not sure if it was the time of the day but there was plenty of seating available between the gates.
Travelling domestically I was checked in under a minute from walking in the door. Security was no hassle either moving through. Went to the lower gate lounge where I would be bussed to my distant awaiting aircraft. However on arriving at the bottom at a small & poorer quality lounge there was no means of going back up into the rest of the airport as the escalators were blocked off. Entire A320 plane load was put onto a single bus for the long distant ride across to the far side of the airport. Not very comfortable especially for several elderly travellers I saw. Hopefully the expanded gates under construction will do away with these long bus transfers.
"It's not a big airport, but clean and good. However, there is not much signage."
The airport itself is nice as others have commented. I travel through here about once a month and the new terminal is very comfortable and pleasant. However the local security is capricious at best. They seem to give security agents very little guidance but a huge amount of leeway. I have had toothpaste confiscated (no pastes they said) a bar of soap (no soaps they said) and the list goes on and on. I am all for reasonable and tight security but it seems like every trip I have a random item confiscated. And it is not just me I see it happen to others all the time too.
Very nice modern airport since it has been recently renovated. The terminal is huge. Good duty free shops and good air-conditioning. Nice staff everything is very clean. Fast and easy security screening.
Guatemala Airport is a clean well maintained airport. Decent choice of food vendors easy check. At the time I was departing the departure and arrivals board was malfunctioning.
Guatemala's new airport is now a very pleasant experience especially when I consider how it was twenty years ago. Agents security and all support staff are friendly and helpful. Clean. Simple but adequate eating options. Spacious and comfortable. Still short-handed on personnel in most every area which makes for long waits if several flights arrive at the same time. Customs recently has gone into overdrive searching for anything they can tax.
Changed planes at GUA enroute from ORD to SJO and return in March 2010 so cannot address check-in customs or security but it was an easy place to change planes. The airport was spacious with plenty of seating and shopping. Duty free was reasonable ($9 for liter of Stoli) and staff friendly. There were a few places to eat and prices were reasonable by airport standards ($1 for water as opposed to $3 in SJO). The bathrooms were clean although the toilets in the men's room didn't seem to have seats. Otherwise a very pleasant place to spend 90 minutes.
"Guatemala City's airport has improved greatly from when I was younger. There are more check-in counters and more gates available. Everything clean and well-maintained. Bathrooms which used to be a gamble are now clean. The airport is small so everything is close together and easy to navigate. The new duty free and other boutiques are a welcome change from the ""mercado central"" feel the shopping area used to have. Customs and migration are simple and the staff are easy to deal with. The only issue I have with this airport is the security personnel. While I understand that all airports have slightly different security measures (Buenos Aires airport doesn't let you take water on the plane even if you bought it after the security checkpoint - ridiculous!) Guatemala's seem particularly arbitrary and not enforced in an even-handed manner. For example the rule is liquids must be in containers holding less than three ounces and in a plastic bag. I forgot the plastic bag detail this time around. After opening the bag and seeing its contents they insisted on the plastic bag. I didn't have one and unlike other airports they didn't offer one and couldn't tell me where to find one. Plus I was running to catch an AA flight (the time had been changed without informing passengers) so I couldn't conduct a search. I resigned myself to having to leave the two oils and cream behind. The security guy took the cream but not the oils as well as a deodorant which of course is technically a solid and should have been left with me. My lesson is learned: pack toiletries in their plastic bags and carry extras in case security is not placated. But I will never know exactly what version of TSA rules Guatemala uses. personnel could stand to be nicer as well. Even the security staff in Miami are nicer."
Just back from Guatemala I was very impressed with the airport. It was spacious clean and well organised. It has a small volume of passengers but is perfectly adequate with friendly helpful staff. A very positive experience!
The newly built North Finger has 14 new gates great shopping/eating and a very modern atmosphere. The original terminal building has been upgraded and expanded restoring much of the appeal it had lost since its construction in the 1960s. It is a beautiful piece of architecture. Overcrowding has been eliminated at check-in thanks to 100 new check-in counters. The remodeling is ongoing and will be complete in November 2007. A new Central Finger (under construction) will add 6 more gates for medium- sized jets or 4 gates for 747s and Airbus A340s.
Overall it is a nice airport with some things to offer. Upon arrival we normally are to our ground transportation within an hour of landing. Immigration takes less than 20 minutes and our luggage has always arrived quickly thereafter. Departing there are some very nice and inexpensive little shops just below the main terminal. My wife and I always save a few quatzales to spend here because we tend to find some unique items. The food is limited but there are some good pastries and excellent coffee for that early morning flight. Yes some updating and general housekeeping may be needed but a good experience overall.
This is a really nice airport. It is not the cleanest in the world but it has things that you will not find in other airports and is in the process of a major overhaul. Instead of being filled with trendy fast food restaurants it has some very nice shops from duty free to typical arts and crafts. Great for the last minute item you did not have time to shop before hand. The customs lines are fast moving and operated by very friendly agents. The biggest problem is trying to leave the airport on a departing flight. There is a trick though. You can actually check in to your flight the day before at a customer service center run by each airline. For specifics call your airline for the closest location. When you get to the airport there is a special line for pre-checked passengers and it can cut your time in line by half. Of course this gives you more to shop at the great 'tiendas'.
I flew to Guatemala city three times this year and I found the airport to be quite adequate. Although it definitely needs some renovations as you can see the wear and tear the airport makes up for it's run down appearance thanks to the people. I found the various staff to be very helpful and courteous. The facility is kept very clean. The shops and food are quite good for a small airport (especially the crepes). My only complaint is that the check in hall becomes very crowded for early morning flights and the lines from each airline start to blend into each other. It becomes a bit chaotic despite the airline staff's attempt to keep people in the right line up. Overall no complaints.
I was in Guatemala Airport at the beginning of 08/05. The airport from the outside is certainly an interesting '60s building if not well maintained. Arrivals is good the lines are quick but the taxi/bus/hire car/hotel desks are before you leave the building and you have to beg and plead to be allowed back in again (without taking luggage)! Departures are good the lines quick people friendly lots of shops to buy last minute tourist tat duty free and Guatemalan fast food (well worth it when you are flying AA to BOS via MIA without even a chance of buying food!). Overall a reasonable experience for a poor country! I especially liked the No dogs and No guns notices on the entrance doors!
A new international airport has become a necessity. Built in 1968 La Aurora is simply obsolete and overcrowded. It has not been remodeled since it opened. The local press has recently highlighted a long list of deficiencies ranging from the shortness of its runway flanked on one side with buildings and a ravine on the other to filthy and oftentimes inoperable restroom facilities. La Aurora is rated as a category 2 airport under international civil aviation safety classifications. The new airport is not expected to be completed until 2010 at the earliest if opposition from groups wanting to keep the airport in Guatemala City doesn't sabotage the government's plans. In the meantime management of La Aurora has been handed over to a joint public/private sector group in the hopes of completing extensive renovations and expansion in the near future.
I go through Guatemala City's La Aurora airport several times each year and am always discovering shops services and other pleasant surprises tucked throughout the terminal which I had overlooked on my previous visits. The only major drawback to La Aurora is that passenger traffic has outgrown available space. During the peak hours -- especially in the early morning -- there is simply nowhere to put the additional staff that could handle the passengers. This can produce a badly overcrowded and somewhat confusing check in area and long lines. Having to go to a separate (and somewhat obscurely located) line to pay a $3 airport security tax produces yet another line but it moves very quickly. These problems can usually be avoided by avoiding an early morning departure and taking a late morning or early afternoon flight. Once you get checked in and have found where to pay your security tax you will be in for a most welcome surprise. The terminal has some of the best shopping in Latin America ranging from tiny shops packed with local crafts at very low prices to the more typical upscale duty free merchandise. There are coffee bars and snack bars throughout -- both before and after passport control.
Relatively small but efficient and clean. General facilities are good good duty free shopping. Some gates are much nicer that others especially toilets. Can be crowded at peak hours but not really a problem to move around or get in or out of it. The government has announced a new larger international airport will be built 60 km. South leaving La Aurora only for local flights and non commercial civil aviation. Eventually both airports are to be connected by a fast rail service.
Guayaquil's airport has most of the services that we have here in Australia they even offer jetways into planes. There are restaurants ATM's machines banks coffee shops and entertainment it passed our expectations without doubt.
Friendly of the staff a new huge mall had been opening Mall del Soll. This is the modern and fully functional airport with the biggest mall of the country and four hotels between 4 & 5 stars.
Arrived in Guayaquil with Avianca from Bogota last week. The airport is a beautiful and modern structure clean and functional. Immigration was less than professional with the agent being rude and curt. On departure after a very quick check-in I once again faced a less than friendly immigration agent. At least the departure tax is now included in the price of your ticket. Jose Joaquim de Olmedo airport is the only choice for southern Ecuador and if not for the poorly trained personnel it provides a good facility for travelers. In the main terminal on arrival there are several eateries to choose from including a few US chains.
Arrived from Miami immigration quick and well organised luggage pick up was relatively fast. Staff speaks limited or no english could not explain why you need to screen your luggage by leaving customs. (Have not seen it at other airports yet). ATM's are available food court offers variety of food though quite expensive.
I use this airport frequently in general is comfortable. Although relatively new terminal it got some issues the air conditioning is usually too hot. The waiting areas are excellent at airside although the reception area could get crowd because is narrow. Toilets are clean but need more attention on supplies. The vertical traffic to the ground and parking area lacks of adequate infrastructure there is only one elevator and just one moving escalator going up.
"Check-in would not accept passengers until 2 hours before the flight despite the monitors advising us to do so. Check in person was blunt and almost rude, not acceptable, we are the customers! It isn't my fault she was talking quietly and I had to ask her to repeat every time. Then security, they take possession of my backpack and without comment put it on a unit away from me and left it there. A couple of minutes later another security man came along and started swabbing the bag because I had lots of camera equipment inside. The toilets in departures need a good refurbishment. Otherwise a great little airport, modern, clean, with duty free and so on."
The Airport is really small and the departures lounge is small and unintuitive. The weird door thing doesn't do anything as you could board any plane once out there. Past security the duty free shop is small and is not a world duty free. There is no WHSmith or Starbucks in the terminal. Otherwise extremely good service.
Please please get some training for your check in crew miserable is a mild word. I have travelled to Guernsey twice this year and both times the check in crew seem to be doing all pax a favour. Many years ago in BMI times in Guernsey this would not have been tolerated. All over Guernsey one gets superb service until you get to the airport and check into or ask a question on the Flybe desk. Having worked in tourism for many years(including Guernsey). I feel you are doing Fly be a great disservice. The flight was excellent and on time. Hope next time I will see a change.
Switching from F to E concourse was a mess. There are no clear signs as to where to go and a large group ended up outside and having to go through security again. This is not acceptable. The airport management needs to have enough signs to get passengers from one concourse to the other. So disappointing!
Straightforward and logically laid out. Vastly better than their neighbors over in Jersey.
The new Guernsey airport is large and spacious. No aero bridges due to the variety of aircraft flying into GCI. Luggage collection was quick. Departures side of the terminal has hire car desks tourist information newsagent and cafeteria style eating area. Upstairs is a spacious bar with viewing area of planes taking off and landing. Bus to St Peter Port is from front of terminal routes 4 and 7. Route 7 in summer you can travel in the other direction to other parts of the island. Bus pass for 10 trips can be bought from tourist office and they also have island wide bus timetables. Plenty of taxi's. Garage next door to re-fuel hire cars prior to drop off. Village of Le Bourg and a small military museum a short walk away if you need to kill time before departure.
Construction of a new terminal had just begun when I used GCI in June 2003. It was a very easy business on arrival as I emerged exactly at the right time to catch a local service bus to St. Peter Port from the stop outside the terminal. The rudimentary facilities at the old terminal were largely shut on the Sunday evening when I checked in for my return flight but occupying my time was no problem as I walked around the corner to the village of Le Bourg and installed myself in the pub there. It took five minutes to return to the terminal. The terminal roof serves as a public viewing area - a pleasantly Olde Worlde experience. Flights to and from GCI can be delayed due to sea fog and mist and I half expected to bump in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as I walked out to board the (propeller) aircraft.
A fairly small airport by Chinese standards but then again so is Guilin. At check-in they waved me over to check in at the VIP line even though I was flying economy nice of them. Despite being small this airport has a nice decor & is clean. Going through security quite smooth & efficient. My main complaint is at departures gates many people smoking & not much in the way of snacks unless you like strange looking Chinese treats that have no English.
Previous comments on GPT are no longer true. Often GPT is cheaper that New Orleans or any other nearby airport. The presence of AirTran keeps fares very reasonable and service is pretty good in all directions. The new terminal to be completed this year will be beautiful.
The airport is small clean and convineent however very expensive. To fly into or out of this airport makes no sense with the outrageous prices. Better prices available from MSY (an hours drive away from the west) and/or MOB (an hours drive from the east). Note - this information is prior to Hurricane Katrina and may not be accurate at the moment but if and when normal operations resume this information will serve similar to pre-Katrina GPT.
Arrived from Hong Kong and flew out next day to Beijing. A nice little tropical type airport compact and fact to be processed. Clean reasonable facilities and nice staff. A really easy entry into China and would like to visit Hainan for longer enxt time.
Haikou Airport is not too bad but the toilet facilities are a bit dirty. They do not provide toilet paper on the toilets so you'll need to get some paper from the paper towel supply next to the toilets. Check-in gates don't seem to be crowded at all. When I got to security I thought it would take quite long but it had been really fast
"The airport of the provincial capital of Haikou on Hainan Island China. Dominated by Hainan Airlines and China Southern Airlines. The exterior looked a little dated and the interior looked a little yellow with age though the check-in counters and washrooms certainly were up-to-date. Custom and security clearance were done smoothly and efficiently. The main airport lobby was a little dark but it was certainly buzzing with activities. The ""International Terminal"" serving Dragonair and Air Macau was tucked into an inconspicuous corner and not properly marked. I did not see any signs either in English or Chinese. Touts littered the airport exits. If you do not mind the haggling 50-60RMB should be about right to get you into the city if not go for the Airport Shuttle bus. Cost you only 25RMB and you can grab a taxi from its terminal for only 10RMB to anywhere within the city itself."
A small modern 5-gate airport. Smiling and timely check-in security and boarding. Pleasant airy shared lounge with good Mongolian and other ethnic items reasonably priced. Ours was the only plane at the airport let alone scheduled to fly around midday but all shops and facilities were fully open and staffed. Only criticism is the lack of a bar which I would prefer to for example the bridal wear store.
Hakodate airport is fairly small but the building is modernised with only two floors. Before the security gate on the second floor a small shopping arcade selling mainly Japanese goods. Like all Japanese domestic airports Hakodate is well organised clean and efficient. It caters mainly for passengers travelling with ANA and JAL two of the major Japanese airlines and Do airline ( a subsidiary of ANA ). If you are staying in the downtown area there is direct airport bus from JAL hotel the Grand hotel and the Hokodate train station to the airport. The bus fare is 600 yens and it takes only 20 minutes.
"Flew via Halifax on way from Heathrow to Toronto. As it's a pretty small airport there's not that much to do apart from look at the lobsters in the lobster shop - we couldn't believe it when so many people were boarding planes carrying lobster boxes! There are a few eateries both land and airside which are not wildly overpriced just average food on offer. Tim Horton's provided a decent sandwich. Overall we quite enjoyed the 3 hours we spent there though. If you go up the lift in the main concourse area there's a small viewing platform room which is a calm and relaxing place to be. We watched the few planes that came in and out for 45 minutes before going through security. Everywhere there are plenty of staff to offer help - all dressed in lovely tartan uniforms and without exception totally friendly. There is also free wifi so we took full advantage of that. We did ask one member of staff if we had time to go and see Halifax. She replied in a friendly but blunt way ""You'd have to take a bus to get there and there's not really much to see anyway!"" It's small but clean efficient and did the job for the few hours' stopover."
Very small but friendly efficient airport. Not a great deal to do and not many shops particularly airside but staff are always remarkably friendly and helpful which makes a change from most other airports I visit.
Every night a 767 leaves Halifax for LHR at 23.45. Every night all the bars restaurants shops etc. close before 2200. This is a grubby little airport with poor facilities. A miserable experience.
Landed here in thick fog check in good first occasion I flew out security was very slow and overly fussy. Second time much better seating plentiful at gates but airside catering facilities and shops limited. Weather can be an issue.
Not at all impressed. Was picking friends up on a flight that was to arrive at 1:55 am just to show up and be told that the screens in the terminal that tell you when your flight is coming are never updated during early morning hours. So about 20 of us are left standing there wondering when it will arrive all the time looking up at a screen that says it has arrived. We finally get an airport that looks like an airport but when it comes to service it's the same old Halifax International Airport. Very disappointing.
One of Canada's smaller airports but not without it's own unique charm
"We were stuck at Halifax International for 24 hours on 2nd Jan. The shopping and eating facilities landside were not too bad although it was very draughty and cold. We found some staff extremely unhelpful. We needed help to get standby tickets after missing a connection due to icy runway. Whichever long queue we stood in we were told it was wrong when we asked ""where then?"" one particular lady shrugged and turned her back. Advice given was extremely poor in our opinion we would have got home at least 24 hours sooner with better help."
The landside vehicle routes parking and rental car areas are awful - but presumably the extensive building works will solve this - but I'd hate to have to use current arrangements in the winter. Inside the terminal and airside are fine though things tend to close down about 2130 which isn't very helpful when the LHR flight doesn't go until 2335.
I am a frequent user of Halifax International and I must say that it deserves the awards it has received. Parking might be bad but the new Park n' Fly lot should help as well as the construction of a new parking structure. Food is ok for a fairly small airport. New US custom pre-clearance should be good for those traveling to the US. The new expansions to the terminal are welcomed.
Halifax Airport takes pride in its advertising plight to say it is recognized world wide in customer service. Their claim to fame is that they have ranked number 1 three years in a row in customer satisfaction. If you dig into the statistics you'll find they participate in a survey of airports with less that 5 million passengers and those airports that do participate are few in number. It wouldn't be that hard to rank number 1. I think the service I have experienced there is far from world renowned and leaves a lot to be desired. Parking is terrible there is minimal shopping and food services other than fast food style. The airport including the runways have been under construction for many years creating constant delays. They obviously have PR staff that are able to use statistics to their best advantage.
The shopping was decent but as for the airport's ability to handle an international flight - not impressed at all. I was flying YHZ - LHR on 31 August. We were left waiting for two hours standing in a queue because a computer broke down then were rudely told by an officer that we would miss our flight if we didn't hurry up. There were no screens to tell us what was going on and those that were there were either wrong or changing so constantly that it was impossible to determine what was going on. In addition the airport is 36km from Halifax - it's in the middle of Nova Scotia near a place called Goffs - but the airport shuttle is good and fairly cheap.
"On arrival we had to board at 36C a bus which took about 7 minutes to the arrival building. Although there were about 200 passengers in queue there were only 3 screening belts open. The flight information board had small letters and were permanently changing. Many passengers were standing like fools in front of it, because they could not catch the right information. The WiFi had a snail speed. After a 15 minute walk we arrived at E. Then the same bus trip to the airplane for Vienna. If this is supposed to be a No.1 airport I can only say not for us."
"I wish Hamad international airport had more restaurants and cafés for travellers to choose, now there is not enough selections and it's too crowded in food area. The airport is so clean and bright and comfortable for the travellers."
"Well designed, ultra modern and huge airport. Lots of cheap tax-free shopping opportunities, plenty of seats and restrooms who were kept clean regularly. Free WIFI provided by the airport. Only minor point is that despite it has many gates, both inbound and outbound flights to Amsterdam were via remote gates. Compared to Abu Dhabi transiting through new Doha airport is a breeze."
"Amazing shops! I would have gone shopping crazy if it wasn't for the short transit time (only had 1.5 hours of transit). The only downside to this was that, we landed at the airport at gate B2 (from Zagreb) and was told that our connecting flight would depart from B5 (to Dubai). My boyfriend and I were excited because when we were about to leave the aircraft we noticed that the gate was very close to us and that we wouldn't be rushing for our connecting flight. Apparently that was not possible as we were required to go back to the main terminal, go through the security checks and then walk back to the B gate area (despite the fact we already have our boarding pass). Other than that, airport is clean and had plenty to do."
"It's new with lots of space and seating but truly the big problem here is if you are transferring/transiting as once off the plane you have big vast walkways on the way to transfer but then you turn a corner and are met with a huge bottleneck and mass of passengers as you have to go through a security screening check which is so crowded both early morning and late at night. This needs to be sorted or doing away with as if you come off a plane and will board another one why would you need to go through a fine security check once again. This really needs to be made more efficient as the security staff are arrogant, unhelpful and rude in the cases I observed as I waited to transfer through. They say there is a fast track but its not sign-posted and passengers were just overwhelming the security area anyway. Signing in this area is pretty poor. The gates C-20-29 are downstairs and its like a sauna down there with inadequate A/C overcrowding of passengers and huge queues just to use the one toilet area there which can not cope with the humanity that flows through there even with attendants trying their best. Badly designed sadly and you still have to use buses would you believe to get to your aircraft from these gates. So you build a huge airport and yet you still have to uses buses and crowded parts of this airport to board a plane. Truly not thought out for passengers sadly in these areas.

What happened to this once great airport? It's still clean and sparkling but what really matters is time. Inbound - it took the airport 45 minutes to deliver the checked luggage to the belt. Excuse was insufficient number of luggage handlers. Outbound - only one person at immigration and plane was delayed because (again) luggage wasn't loaded due to handler shortage. What a shame once upon a time this was a superb super efficient and very fast airport. This is has clearly gone.
Excellent in all respects. Efficiently laid out clean courteous personnel good selection of shops and restaurants comfortable and plentiful seating. Most wondrous and remarkable to this United States visitor public transportation that runs regularly and on schedule between the airport basement and the city.
Nothing to criticise. Arriving was extremely easy despite being bussed from the aircraft we were on the S-bahn within 15 minutes of leaving the aircraft. Departure also stress-free a short wait for security and passport checks but nothing much and no queue at all at the check-in desk. Facilities in the departure area well up to standard. As seems usual in Germany public transport to and from the city is excellent - cheap comfortable and reliable.
Midsize airport with excellent lay-out. Short distances from arrival gate to luggage belt quick baggage delivery with priority baggage being put first on the belt. Friendly and very competent tourist info offering all types of information and booking support. The best place to obtain your train or boat tickets or tickets to cultural events. Airport has S-Bahn link to central railways station. Ideal gateway to the North of Germany.
Flew in from MUC on 29 August and out to EDI on 2 Sep. Arrival was straightforward with bags on the belt in reasonable time. The direct S-Bahn connection to the city centre is frequent and the fare a very modest EUR2.95. Departure was also fine apart from a few minor niggles spoiling the experience. The up escalator to Terminal 1 departures was out of action leaving a choice between carrying heavy cases upstairs or cramming into a lift. Didn't it occur to anybody to reverse the direction of the down escalator which was still working? Secondly the security staff put my passport and boarding pass into the tray to go through screening (why?) but in such a position that they fell out as the tray left the machine. Luckily I noticed this and they were retrieved with no harm done but such carelessness with essential documents isn't good enough. More seriously both male and female toilets at Gate C06 were out of action (and seemed to have been for some time) with only a tiny notice in German to warn you. Since you have to go through Passport Control to reach the gate there is no access to alternative toilets unless you can persuade the Passport staff to let you back out. Fortunately my flight was well up to time but I hate to think what would happen if there was a significant delay. I've always found HAM a pleasant easy airport to use and I hope standards are not going to be allowed to slip.
"Flying from Vienna arrival on time gangway quickly installed baggage delivery clearly indicated as well as belt number. And then the so-famous German efficiency took a hard beating. Despite landing at 7.30 pm well past the rush hour we were kept waiting in front of the belt with absolutely no information (at a time our flight number even disappeared of the screens as ""delivered"") for 45 minutes! The few other flights were in the same situation. On the way out rent a car not too far away globally design is acceptable. No particular comments when we left the following day."
Slightly slow Passport Control arriving lunchtime on a Saturday in T2 due to arrival of 2 other flights at the same time however bags were waiting on the belt. Easy access to the local rail service into the city of Hamburg along with very good Tourist Information Desk in the Arrivals Hall. Returned through on Tuesday afternoon with minimal delays at both Check-in or Security. Good selection of shops after Security along with a choice of cafes/bars. A clean and spacious airport which is remarkably busy but not crowded. T1 and T2 are just different ends of the same long Departure Hall.
Swift clean and easy to use with clear signs. At ground level are the Supermarkets and Cafe offering nice option for buffet and coffee. Restaurants on level two offer a good view but lounges on level three has view over runway. At luggage collection area they have displayed the information boards from Deutsche Bahn for connecting trains to Hamburg Central Station and to other cities. Excellent planning efficient clean and friendly airport!
BRU–HAM–WAW. Was on transit between two flights. Nice and modern airport good facilities only complaint was that the staff at the security gate were unfriendly and arrogant.
I have used this airport for over 20 yrs and it has always been my favourite one. I travel regularly all over the world and this one takes some beating. At Hamburg I recommend you go upstairs to eat it's much nicer than some of the small cafes on the ground floor. Efficient and clean everywhere.
Airport is been completely renovated and made modern and easy-to-use. Hamburg airport is connected with train which departs at every 20 mins and takes about 25 mins to reach the city centre. The facilities inside the airport are very good. Clean toilets Supermarket few clothing stores Restaurants located just above the check in counters. Parking area is spacious although a little expensive. The staff at security gate is supportive and friendly.
"Hamburg Airport just announced in March 2011 a new structure for the parking fees there. In the media it sounds very nice and looks at a first glance like an advantage for the travellers. But what they did not announce is that at the weekends where many travellers are doing city trips the fees have been increased by nearly 50%! So instead of 39EUR for a weekend (Friday evening to Monday morning) parking it now cost you 54EUR. The cost per day is now 18EUR instead of 13EUR before! I am pretty sure that this new pricing structure is not an advantage for the travellers as announced in the media but rather an advantage for the owner of the parking lots. I would appreciate if such public installations like airports would show more dignity and call their ""changes in price structure"" what they really are namely ""price increasing"". And not just show the small advantage for some few travellers while hiding the big disadvantages for many other travellers."
Very friendly airport. Good and fast services clean and modern facilities enough space. Sometimes a considerable walking distance however nothing like FRA or CDG. Excellent train connection to town.
Hamburg Airport is linear a bit like an updated version of the the old Berlin Tempelhof and it is quite a hike from one end to the other. So arriving passengers from the UK (eg Easyjet & BA) beware as your gates are quite a hike from baggage reclaim in Terminal 1 and there are no moving walkways for the less mobile. On the plus side
Hamburg Airport is getting better. Friendly modern clean nice shopping Areas and a short walk to the check-in counters. By train you will be in just 25 minutes in the city center.
An excellent and compact facility. Easy arrival not far to go for passport control (no queue) and short walk thereafter to retrieve luggage. Plenty of glass gives the terminal building a bright and airy feel. A nice touch: when two or more flights use the same belt a message on the screen tells those waiting which flight's luggage is on the belt. Departure was similarly painless from alighting the cab the short walk to the Lufthansa check-in and subsequent luggage screening with a priority queue for those elite travellers with status. Screeners friendly and professional. New shopping facilities greet those wishing to spend. Only gripe - the LH lounge wasn't easy to find.
I recently landed at Hamburg and took the train to my hotel. This is new and none of my friend in Hamburg had used it yet. I did have to change trains once but it was very easy. I had help from 3 assistants in buying my ticket and figuring out the best station to stop at. A very nice experience and very inexpensive. What a great town Hamburg is at least when the weather is good.
A bit remote for public transport but easy access by car convenient rental car return near the terminals and short ways within the terminals. Restaurant service after security is not good so eat before.
The airport itself is quite nice enough but they do need to implement a system to get to the city preferably on a train. I had to take a bus then a train and it was all quite confusing. The bus is not located just near the station and if it weren't for very nice and helpful people I would never have found it.

Departed and arrived at HAM for a day trip to LGW with Germanwings. Had checked-in at home and had only carry-on luggage for this short trip. Found parking right in front of terminal early in the morning and was through security and at the gate within 10 minutes. Sufficient number of shops but a bit pricey. WiFi worked flawless and not too expensive at EUR 5.00 for one hour. Upon return the same evening was off the plane and in my car within 10 minutes on the A7 heading home within 20 minutes from arrival. Overall very clean and modern environment. Will have no problems using HAM again in the future.
"At the first look HAM Airport is a great airport. But it is really a nightmare when you transfer through it. When you arrive on a regional airplane or your plane is parked off-gate arriving into terminal 1you can't transfer airside that means you have to go through customs leave the security area go upstairs and queue at the security check again. And if you are on a tight connection you will surely miss your flight. Although there is a staircase up including manned security check point available you can't use it. If you ask the staff why you can't just use the stairs they say ""because you can't!"". In Terminal 2 at equal location it is no problem to use the stairs nor is it a problem to change flights airside when using an air bridge in both terminals. This is absolutely nonsense - and nobody sofar could explain to me why this is. So beware: When you fly via HAM make sure that your plane always gets an airbridge position or leave plenty of time to make your connex!"
